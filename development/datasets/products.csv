<br><a href=""https://www.momentomoriwines.com.au/"">Momento Mori</a> Rack &amp; Ruin comprises of approx 70% Ribolla Gialla and 30% Nero D’avola grown in the rocky, volcanic soils of Mt Camel, Heathcote. The two wines were made separately and also aged separately (100% stainless steel) as it was the intention to release them as individual wines. As it were they were probably the two most standout wines in the winery, a winery full of standout wines.. (2021 was a very good year). Because of that the wine maker found himself drinking these wines from the tank often rather than opening a bottle from the cellar. And because of the proximity of both of the tanks (right beside each other) he naturally had to try them as a blend in my glass. It was somewhat of a revelation, the classic case of the whole being greater than the sum of it’s individual parts.</div>
<div class=""product-info-block product-info-block--product-marketing""></div>
<div class=""product-info-block product-info-block--product-marketing"">It was an easy decision to blend these wines considering that this Ribolla Gialla component would have been one of the first Ribollo Gialla’s to be released in Australia, and from some of the only vineyard plantings of the variety in the country. But, beauty has to have the final say. The subsequent wine is stellar on so many levels ! The wine drinks like a light red / dark rosé and should be consumed chilled. <br><br>

<div class=""column"">The wine has a fragrance of ripe red fruits such as plums and dark cherries, with earthy complexity and yet still expressing minerality. Maintaining a good acidity lends to outstanding freshness with a well integrated ripe and seductive tannin structure.<br>
</div>
<div class=""column"">Incorporating a minimal winemaking intervention approach, such as natural ferment and only two ""punch downs"" daily, retains silkiness and elegance.</div>
<div class=""column""></div>
<div class=""column"">The grapes are picked from a small 3 hectare vineyard. The vineyard is divided up into 5 different parcels each with its own respective clone. The soil, trellising and canopy management is constant through out the vineyard so it is the actual clonal characteristics that determine the different dates of harvest. Over the years we have learnt that there is as much as 11 - 14 days difference between picking the first clone to picking the last clone. The bunches are chilled to 3°C before being sorted on a conveyor and destemmed. Berries are then hand sorted, before cold maceration ensues for 3 to 6 days at 8°C. We try to naturally ferment 100% of the different parcels of grapes making up the Mount Bullet. Fermentation temperatures vary between 26 - 30°C. After pressing, the wine is racked and left to complete its malolactic fermentation and maturation in oak barriques.</div>
</div>
</div>
<br>
</div>
100% matured in barriques (225L) for approximately 20 months using a blend of 3 Bordeaux cooperages. The oak used is of a tighter grain and medium toasted.</div>

<div class=""column"">Rockford needs no introduction, although most of the plaudits go to their red wines. This tawny is a fitting tribute to founder Robert O’Callaghan’s restored 1897 Paddle Steamer Marion; with the very old base wine being refreshed each year with small casks as they reach maturity. <br>
</div>
<div class=""column""></div>
<div class=""column"">
<strong>Taste profile</strong>: Rockford P.S Marion Tawny NV is packed with gentle dark fruit and dried/caramelized fruit notes and lots of baking spice complexity. You can happily leave an open bottle in a dark place to sip over the course of a few months, though we find it tends to disappear pretty quickly. The dark horse of the Rockford range.</div>
<div class=""column""></div>
<div class=""column"">
<strong>Winemaking process</strong>: <meta charset=""utf-8"">This wine is a small contribution to the Barossa's great tradition of producing outstanding, aged fortified wines. The many years the wine was allowed to mature in seasoned, small oak casks encourages the flavours to slowly concentrate and develop into a rich, complex and spicy Barossa Tawny.</div>

<div class=""Polaris-Header-Title__TitleMetadata_19y17"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">Lingua Franca Estate Chardonnay has been recognized as among the finest in the world since its first release. The excitement of its flavors comes from the meticulous guardianship of its terroir in the vineyard and in the winery. Lingua Franca Estate Chardonnay’s aroma is a combination of creamy lemon custard, struck flint, grapefruit zest, with the floral note of jasmine. On the palate it is creamy with peaches and citrus fruit notes and a bright, mineral crystalline core. While it has the richest aroma and texture of all our Chardonnays, it is still lively and bright, lifted by its underlying energy. It is an excellent expression of our vineyard and has already demonstrated the ability to age beautifully.<br>

<div class=""Polaris-Header-Title__TitleMetadata_19y17"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">Lingua Franca Estate Chardonnay is sourced exclusively from the home vineyard that gives expression to a distinctively mineral quality in our white wines. Our Chardonnay blocks are located on the stoniest soils we have, with topsoil averaging 3 feet deep over bedrock of 150 feet of red basalt. Half of our original vineyard Chardonnay is planted from CH548 cuttings taken from the fabled Montrachet vineyard of Burgundy and the rest is our trusted CH 76. The vineyard was recovering from drought in the previous year, so that the harvest again brought in low yields but of excellent quality and intensity. Harvest proceeded with fruit in perfect balance.<br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br>

<div class=""Polaris-Header-Title__TitleMetadata_19y17"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">The release of Estate Chardonnay required a rigorous selection of the best barrels and extensive trials by our team. When the wines were tasted blind, the consensus was that these parcels within the Chardonnay blocks were the finest representation of our Estate for this vintage. The wines were barrel fermented with wild yeast and no acid additions and left unmoved sur lie, or on the lees until they were assembled and readied for bottling. The wines selected were aged in a combination of 21% new 600-liter French oak barrels and 79% neutral French puncheons and barriques for 11 months. Then the wines were put back in tank with their lees for five months prior to bottling.<br>

<div class=""Polaris-Header-Title__TitleMetadata_19y17"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">Estate grown Avni 2019 Pinot Noir is focused and concentrated with an overlying elegance and silky mouthfeel. The large proportion of complexly flavored, savory and mineral upper block fruit combines seamlessly with the rounder flavors of Pommard clone on Jory soils. Though the vineyard was still recovering from drought, the fruit quality was nearly perfect, as temperatures were moderate at harvest, and we avoided the later rains.<br>

<div class=""Polaris-Header-Title__TitleMetadata_19y17"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">Hand-harvested Avni Pinot Noir 2019 was fermented with 14% whole cluster fruit. The grapes were fed by bin into medium sized stainless steel and cement fermenting tanks. Pigeage was done traditionally by foot to ensure a gentle extraction of tannins. The fermentation was with wild yeast. The wines aged in 21% new and 79% old French oak barriques for 12 months and four in tank prior to bottling. 11% of the total, PN115 from Block 9, was fermented using 100% whole cluster carbonic fermentation.<br>

<div class=""Polaris-Header-Title__TitleMetadata_19y17"" data-mce-fragment=""1"">The vineyard was recovering from drought so that the harvest again brought in low yields but of excellent quality and intensity. Harvest proceeded with fruit in perfect balance. Lingua Franca Avni Pinot 2019 is our most layered yet, with distinctive fruit sourced from the upper blocks, blended equally with fruit from the deeper Jory soils of our lower blocks, where vines develop round textures and red fruit flavors.<br>

<div class=""column"">Balance and elegance is paramount to our approach in the vineyard and the winery. The grapes were hand-harvested and destemmed to tanks with only minimal SO2 added. After about 4 days the indigenous yeast fermentation began, and the wine was pigeaged or pumped-over twice a day during this period. Temperatures were not allowed to exceed 28°C and fermentation lasted 10 to 18 days, followed by 3 weeks extended maceration, after which the wine was drained and pressed to barrels. In the late winter, the wines were racked, then blended in spring and bottled after 20 months in barrel.<br data-mce-fragment=""1"">

The vineyard sits approximately 100 metres above sea level and benefits from great diurnal temperature variations. The warmer temperatures during the day and cooler nights encourage the grapes to have a long maturation period, with the heat of the day promoting sugar accumulation, while the cooler nights preserve the acidity levels. The vines go through Espalier training and grow in soils that are clayey, thin and full of rocks.</div>

Brewing sake since 1637. Japan's tradition of sake making began more than 2,000 years ago shortly after rice cultivation was introduced from China. Though the first few centuries yielded a beverage quite unlike that of today, years of experience perfected brewing techniques and increased sake's overall appeal and popularity.<br>In 1905, the brand name Gekkeikan (meaning ""crown of laurel"") was adopted as the company's formal pledge to excellence. Through this commitment, the company became a true leader in the industry and pioneered a number of research and development efforts. The successful results of these endeavors have enabled Gekkeikan to become one of the nation's most popular brands.<br>While 65% of the sake market is made using much less expensive table rice, this premium bottle is made of 100% Yamadanishiki rice. The difference is that sake rice has lesser fats and protein contents but more starch contents compared to table rice. And this difference is key in producing premium sakes.<strong style=""font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'segoe ui', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'helvetica neue', sans-serif;""> </strong><br>

By applying the secondary fermentation technique and the production method of champagne, we are able to elevate, in 8 years, the gas pressure level inside the bottle to that of champagne while removing the lees and achieving a transparent sake. This sake, with its rich flavor, stands in harmony next to both sweetness and sourness. The authentic flavor of the Japanese sake brings out the taste of the Japanese cuisine, while the refreshing fizz of the bubbles and the pleasing acidity favors French and Italian flavors. </span>

<br>Harvested grapes for processing are delivered in a special room ""Marani""(winery). The grapes are crushed by foot, it is the most gentle method for producing mash, because the bones are not damaged, so when it being crushed it stays attached and gives the wine a strong bitterness. he resulting mass is transported into a large ceramic jug - Kvevri, aka clay pots. The pots are buried in the ground and only the opening is at floor level. Dipping into the ground, Kvevri allows to achieve a relatively constant temperature (about 14 C) during fermentation of wort, as well as during storage. Fermentation is performed on pulp until it is finished, usually, it takes 7-8 days. The grape juice fermented on pulp gives the wine a pleasant astringency, which is characteristic for Georgian wines. Wine material wanders there 3 or 4 months with the skin, seeds and twigs.<br>

<br>100% Chardonnay from vines with an average age of 40-years-old. A blend of the best parcels from Pouilly-Fuissé's amphitheatre in the Mâconnais (Burgundy) region. The vines were planted between 2017 and 1947, a little more than 70 years separate the youngest vines from the oldest. A third of the vines grow on west-facing granite soil - a mixture of schists, volcanic sedimentary sands and rhyolitic tuff. The remainder face east and are mostly planted on limestone and Jurassic marls, but there are also some deposits of clay.<br>Hand harvesting and gentle whole bunch pressing of the grapes. Just over half the wine (55%) matures in stainless steel tanks. The remaining 45% matures in barrels, none of which are new (2nd to 5th use only). Bottling with the waning moon.<br>

The combination of these two sites produces a vibrant expression of classic Central Otago Pinot Noir.<br>The name ""Moonlight Race"" comes from a water pathway that passes through the Burn Cottage property. This pathway is one of the hundred of water channels, or ""races"", which were born during the early years of European immigration to bring water down from the Pisa Mountain Range.<br>Burn Cottage uses biodynamic practices and moon phases to farm their property and vineyard. After indigenous fermentation, the wine ages for 12 months in (25% new) French oak barriques. No filtering before bottling to preserve the character of this noble grape.<br>

During the summer the African winds cause a rapid and marked rise of the thermometer and high-temperature variation.<br>In the last ten days of September, the perfect ripeness of the grapes is reached and winemaking process starts from the vine. The withering process takes place in the vineyard by cutting the petiole of grapes but leaving them on the vine for about 15-20 days, during this period 50% of their weight evaporates. This will allow for wines with typical notes of ripe fruits, such as plums and raisins. The hand-picked grapes are pressed and fermented. The skins are left in contact with the must for a long period to extract flavours and the characteristic red colour. Subsequently, the wine is left to complete the malolactic fermentation; this contributes to the peculiar complexity of this wine.

<br>Terroir Sense Fronteres began as a quest to harness the unique minerality and soul of Montsant and give liquid voice to the restraint and freshness of these clay and sand hills surrounding Priorat. Brisat is a dry, white blend of grenache blanc (75 %) and macabeo (25 %) whose name means ‘skin-fermented’ in Catalan. And indeed half of the grapes are vinified for 5 - 7 days on the skins, while the other half are directly pressed in whole bunches with wild yeast in Inox tanks. Both batches then undergo 6 - 8 months of aging, also in Inox. With low alcohol levels and a dedication to organic farming, this is the rare entry-level white that speaks of and for the region, a message in a bottle that rewards those who choose to listen.<br> <br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12411"" style=""font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/alcohol-1-300x300.png?v=1642666758"" alt="""" width=""78"" height=""78""><span style=""font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"">11.5%</span><br>Explore <a href=""https://www.boundbywine.com/product/terroir-sense-fronteres-negre/"">other wines from Terroir Al Limit</a>.<br><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">AWARDS &amp; ACCOLADES</span></strong><br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12884"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/robert-parker-300x119.png?v=1642750481"" alt="""" width=""234"" height=""93""> <strong>- 92 Points</strong><br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-20569"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/guiapenin-300x152.jpg?v=1642759931"" alt="""" width=""223"" height=""113""> <strong>- 90 Points</strong><br>

<br>100% Garnacha Tintorera. The fruit of this unique variety comes from Bodegas Santa Cruz de Alpera's vineyards. The vineyards sit at an altitude between 850–1050 metres, and have limestone soils and poor organic matter. The climate is rigorous, dry and continental, with very cold winters and very hot summers, cold nights and hot days. These conditions lengthen the maturation process and make the fruit produce concentrated tannins and colour in the last stages of maturation.<br>

It's from the Botter family winery, founded in Puglia in 1928. There they employ the skills of winemaker Marco Flacco. For extra power and intensity, he used pure Negroamaro taken from the tiny enclave of Copertino. He vinified the main batch, but let a portion of the grapes ripen longer on the vine and fermented them separately. The main wine is then repassed over the grape skins from the longer hang portion to start a second fermentation. The result is a more intense, punchy and weighty style. It's much like Ripasso they use in the north and the results are rich and spicy.<br><strong>Top tip: </strong>Open this lovely bottle early and decant. Serve with a hearty casserole or grilled meats.<br>

Inzolia wines are moderately aromatic and tend to display nutty, citrusy characters with herbal notes.<br>The grape has a long and complicated history. It is thought to have originated on the island of Sicily, and is related to other Sicilian natives like Grillo and Nerello Mascalese, but other sources have argued that Inzolia is related to the Roditis and Sideritis grape varieties of Greece.<br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12411"" style=""font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/alcohol-1-300x300.png?v=1642666758"" alt="""" width=""78"" height=""78""><span style=""font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif"">12%</span><br>Give other <a href=""https://www.boundbywine.com/product/b-io-bpuntoio-nero-davola-rosato-terre-siciliane-organic-igp/"">Terre Sicilliane IGP wines</a> a try.<br> <br><h1></h1><br>",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0684/6336/2367/products/Sibiliana-Roceno-Inzolia-Bianco.jpg?v=1690804914,BBW-WINE-114,33.0000000000

The grape is cultivated across Italy but Piedmont is the best-known region for producing varietal Malvasia Nera wines whilst in Apulia, Malvasia Nera is blended with Negroamaro. The Malvasia Nera grape produces wines that are light to medium-bodied with notes of cherries, plums and chocolate.</div>

<br>Sauvignon Blanc grapes are well suited to the cool climate region of Elgin. The aim is to produce a wine that has restrained yet full flavours without compromising acidity, with a long, clean, fresh finish. By hanging the grape clusters, a little longer on the vines in cooler climates, more fruit flavours can evolve in the berry whilst maintaining good acidity during ripening.<br>Vineyards are south-east facing on a combination of Table Mountain Sandstone and Bokkeveld Shale. Cool maritime conditions prevail in the Elgin Valley to ensure freshness and a definition of classic Sauvignon Blanc character. Upright vigorous leaf canopies are carefully maintained to maximise fruit to leaf ratio which is critical for balanced and intense fruit flavour profiles.<br>Grapes were hand harvested. After pressing, the must was settled. Fermentation was inoculated with a commercial yeast strain particularly suited to Sauvignon Blanc and the temperature was maintained at 14oC. The wine was kept on gross lees (yeast solids) for four months and stirred periodically to enhance mid-palate richness. There was a 12% cask fermented Semillon fraction blended to broaden the mid-palate slightly. The final wine was lightly fined and filtered into bottle.<br>

Once at the winery, the grapes were slowly pressed to extract must. After this occurs, the seeds are separated from the must in order to obtain the best aromas and flavours during the fermentation process.<br>This process happens over the course of 14 days in a controlled temperature of 16 ºC. The must ferments in an homogeneous, slow, and orderly way. Once fermented, we transfer the juice to its lees, where it spends 2 months aging on the lees, which adds to much more complex aromas and flavors that evolve over time. The wine is then removed from its lees, racked and then bottled after tartaric stabilization occurs.<br>In 1988, a local Rioja winemaker found a bunch of white grapes growing in the midst of one his tempranillo parcels in his Murillo de Río Leza property in the Rioja Baja.

Not many vineyards from any country use Sauvignon Gris and even fewer producers make wine from 100% Sauvignon Gris.<br>The grapes for this wine come entirely from Loveblock's family-owned Farm in the Lower Awatere sub-region of Marlborough. The elevation and windy location here challenges the vines.

Tempos Vega Sicilia Alión has a shiny ruby red. It is intense and complex, bursting with notes of red and black berries and plums. It gradually develops some hints of tomato leaf, nutmeg, clove, allspice and cigar box. Luscious and intense with high acidity and velvety tannins with a cherry aftertaste lasting for minutes<br>Alión comes from a careful selection of terroirs dotted across the very best areas of the Ribera del Duero DO. These soils, which complement each other, along with the same winemaking process as Vega Sicilia, have given rise to wines with a firm structure. 2017 was the 'vintage of the frost' (April 28), but this affected the wines less than it could have, thanks to the policy of producing 25 % more than they need, and to the double pruning carried out in the winter. 2017 was a challenging vintage, but with a glorious end result, sustaining the genuine, modern and multicultural character of Alión of somewhat warmer and firmer expression.<br>
<div class=""description"">
<br>Wine produced using the Tinto Fino variety. The grapes are harvest by hand in 12-kg boxes and are taken immediately to the winery to the sorting tables. Fermentation takes place in wooden tanks under controlled temperatures until a good polyphenolic structure is obtained which will provide the generous colour and firm structure that makes up part of the personality of this wine; and finally the ageing of between 12 and 14 months. In this drier and warmer vintage, the contribution of oak was reduced, using 72 % new barrel, 18 % used barrel and 10 % concrete, with a view to working on the tannin texture, on the one hand, and the freshness and journey of the wine, on the other.<br>Once the wine is removed from the barrels, it will remain no less than 15 months in the stillness of the bottle, where it will end up assembling all the primary aromas of the fruit with the hues from its delicate ageing, resulting in an intense, complex and fleshy wine, but where the elegance is a distinguishing feature and hallmark of the winery.<br>

The conditions from Spring until harvest were unseasonal and unexpected, making life very difficult. Strong winds added to this, and with uneven ripeness a concern, it wasn’t easy to work out the ideal picking date. Having said that, with yields down and by paying careful attention at harvest, we were able to turn a difficult year into a decent one.<br>39% Chenin Blanc , 31% Semillon, 30% Sauvignon Blanc<br>The White Blend was made to be a true South African style, unlike any other worldwide. The winemakers felt that been forced to copy wine styles from other countries for so long, so this is something entirely different; a unique blend of terroirs rather than just a blend of varietals. The blend will always stay the same; it will always be Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Chenin Blanc. The 2010 vintage was less expressive than 2009, and, therefore, the three components were used in more equal parts than in any of the previous vintages. The wine shows tropical fruit intensity from Chenin Blanc and ends in a lingering citrus finish, contributed by the Sauvignon Blanc, while the Semillon provides structure to complete the blend.<br>Ripening and picking differ year on year. Each vineyard was fermented individually, then leave it on the lees as long as possible. Part of the Chenin Blanc and Semillon gets fermented in French Oak Barrels to give it depth through the middle palate. No additional chemicals (apart from sulphur at bottling) are added, trying to keep them as natural as possible to allow them to age. All the wines are left one lees for as long as possible because this is where the personality of the vineyard shows. After a couple of months, the blending starts. Any name of the vineyard or cultivar that can influence the winemaker was removed, and the vintage was taken into consideration when blending. That is why the percentages of the cultivars change from vintage to vintage. The wine is made to show the diversity of cultivars and terroirs in one bottle that only the Western Cape can produce.<br>Due to minimal interference and no additions (apart from minimal sulphites upon bottling). Now over 10 years in bottle, it is currently drinking beautifully, but it still a baby. There is remarkable freshness and acidity, along with the sort of body that makes this a friend of so many different dishes.

<div class=""product-tasting-notes"">
<a href=""http://www.cmwines.co.za/online/Factsheets/FS_FAC_CB20.pdf"">Catherine Marshall Chenin Blanc</a> is meticulously grown in the cool Elgin Valley and a small portion from old bush vines in Stellenbosch and fermented in handmade, old world styled traditional clay amphorae. These key attributes afford a wine with broad layers of ripe pears, fresh stone fruit and white flowers on a canvas of flinty, wet stone that contributes to the overall texture.</div>

<div title=""Page 1"" class=""page"">
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">
<br>The Chenin for the Fine Art Collection reflects a sophisticated approach to a variety that is widely planted in the Western Cape. A cool site in a unique part of the Elgin Valley was selected specifically for its flinty, wet stone attributes that would enhance restraint and classical notes with a modern new world touch. The Chenin from the Bottelary Hills in Stellenbosch contributes fleshy nectarine and richness on the mid-palate for added complexity.<br>Grapes were selected from a single vineyard in Elgin grown on red Laterite Soils also known as “koffieklip” or coffee stone as it resembles the same structure as ground coffee. The vines are vertically shoot positioned on a 5-wire fence trellis system planted 2.2m x 1.2m apart on south to south-east facing vineyards for maximum, even budburst in spring and even vine ripening throughout the season. The Chenin grown in Bottelary Hills is from old bush vines on lighter soil structure. Harvest took place in early March at vine ripeness.<br>Cluster and berry sorting prior to being partially crushed before pressing commenced. The mash was pressed in a pneumatic bag press where both free run and pressed juice fractions were treated oxidatively with minimal chemical additives. The juice was settled cold at 120 Celsius in a stainless- steel tank for two days and decanted into the clay amphorae for spontaneous fermentation. Once fermentation was completed, 800 Li was decanted to oak casks for further maturation. The wine in the French coopered barrels was partially allowed to go through secondary fermentation known as malo- lactic fermentation where malic (the firmer green apple tasting acid) is converted to lactic (softer milk tasting acid) and further matured for 9 months. The clay amphorae had no malo-lactic fermentation so that the fresher flinty character would be maintained. After 9 months, the two components were blended and bottled.<br><strong>Top Tips: </strong>The wine is approachable in its youth with fresh, bright aromatics and may age well for up to 8 years. Primary fruit aspects include white pears, fresh nectarines and may evolve into almond paste, baked apple and spicy cardamom notes.<br>

<br>Riesling grapes are perfectly suited to cold climates and Riesling is known as an “Eskimo” variety. Since Elgin has cool daytime climate and cold nights during the growing season, it is perfectly suited to produce a Cape version of the famous German “Mosel” style.<br>The grapes are sourced from two vineyards. One is on a south-east facing slope in the Kogelberg Biosphere rich in plant diversity besides vineyards and the other site is on a higher, western slope close to the Groenlandberg spur section of the Hottentots Holland range that encircles the Elgin Valley.<br>Clusters were handpicked at 19.8o Balling into lug baskets and hand sorted. After pressing, the must was settled for two days and decanted off the solids where it was inoculated with a commercial yeast strain suited to this variety. The wine fermented cold (14°C) for 26 days until it reached the residual sugar required for sweetness to balance the acidity. The final wine was fined and lightly filtered to bottle.<br>

The Steading Blanc is a seamless wine with a silken texture that can be enjoyed with a rich crustacean based sauce and anything from the sea.<br><br>Inspired by the rich, luscious and mineral-scented dry whites of the Rhône Valley, The Steading - Blanc is sourced entirely from the Descendant Vineyard on Roennfeldt Road first planted in 1994 on the Torbreck estate. The ripe, fleshy, barrel fermented Viognier (20%) and Marsanne (30%) give the palate a textural edge whilst the Roussanne (50%) contributes it’s more flinty and austere personality.<br>An above average winter rainfall led into a below average spring and summer rainfall, producing small bunches and small berries, leading to a reduced yield. Quality was certainly high, particular amongst our red varieties of Shiraz, Grenache and Mataro. 2018 wines will be remembered for their impressive colour, structure and longevity.</div>

A lively, vibrant aroma of blackberry, violet and spice. A full, rich mid palate with a vivacity and energy that this blend always generates. Ripe, savoury flavours of dark berry fruit and cassis, spiced cherries, minerals and succulent blueberry fruit all balanced with fresh acidity and a fine gentle tannin structure. Dense and vibrant, this wine is drinking superbly but, as with its predecessors, it will greatly reward those who choose to give it a few years in the cellar.<br><br>Cuvée Juveniles was created as a ‘Cote Du Rhone’ inspired bistro wine from the classic Barossa varieties of Grenache (61%), Mataro (28%) (Mourvedre) and Shiraz (11%) from mostly old, unirrigated vineyards. These varieties are the cornerstone of the Barossa Valley and are intrinsic in the wines that are so easily appreciated around the world and often referred to as GSM blends by sommeliers and consumers alike. The grapes are from multiple vineyards ranging from 40 - 150 year old vines. The wines were assembled in tanks and allowed to complete a natural malolactic fermentation before bottling.<br>After a cold and rainy winter in 2016, the Barossa had one of its wettest springs on record, replenishing sub-soil moisture and setting the vineyards up for a healthy summer. Mild conditions during veraison and light rains in January and February 2017, were followed by an extended warm, dry Indian summer, creating perfect ripening conditions through to April 2017. An outstanding vintage producing bright, aromatic whites and intense, well-structured reds.<br>

<a href=""https://torbreck.com/collections/wines"">Torbreck Old Vines Grenache Shiraz Mourvèdre</a> has notes of rich black cherries, red berries with hints of earthy, leathery and spices. It is elegantly styled with attractive and persistent fruity flavours accompanied by wonderful spicy notes. This bottle of GSM has a medium-full body with fresh and lively acidity. The texture is silky, with a long finish that ends with subtle leather and wood.<br><br>This red wine is a blend of 62% Grenache, 26% Shiraz, and 12% Mourvèdre that was hand-harvested from old vines, some as much as 100 years old, from the sub-regions of Marananga, Gomersal, and Ebenezer. As each parcel of grapes enters the winery, they were fermented in a combination of open top cement and wooden vats, as well as stainless steel tanks. It was aged in well-seasoned French oak hogsheads for 24 months. Each parcel was kept separate throughout the vinification process, until it was finally blended and bottled.<br>During the growing season in the Barossa Valley, a wet spring replenished sub-soil moisture, while a warm, dry Indian summer created perfect ripening conditions through to April 2017, resulting in an outstanding vintage that produced intense, well-structured reds. I had the opportunity to taste this 2017 back in January 2020 and am curious to see how it has evolved since then.</div>

A wine that shows lifted aromas of fresh citrus fruits and flowers along with kaffir lime perfumes. The palate is tangy with long acidity and cleansing to the finish. Either as a fresh young wine or aged for up to 12 years to reveal brioche and lemon curd pastry like notes. The Lemon butter complexities are a real delight from 7-12 years.<br><br>Semillon has always found a natural home in the Barossa. It was one of the early white wine grape varieties planted by the first settlers around 160 years ago and the Mediterranean climate and careful farming has created a heritage of old, low yielding Semillon vineyards. With the use of an age-old, robust, pink-skinned Madeira clone, found mainly in the Barossa, the Woodcutter’s - Semillon is reminiscent of the savoury white wines found in the central and southern regions of France.<br>The 2021 summer growing season was mild, with even and cool daily temperatures throughout. Enhanced by good rains provided during the winter and spring of 2020, our vineyards grew wonderful canopies and developed well-formed grape bunches. As a result of this long flavour development cycle in the vineyard, 2021’s signature is wines of high aromatic lift with densely coloured tints and exceptional balance.<br><br>

<a href=""https://www.smith-haut-lafitte.com/en/home/"">Château Smith Haut Lafitte</a> Le Petit Haut Lafitte is a second wine from a top estate in the Pessac-Léognan appellation, Bordeaux. This red has a beautiful depth, density and complexity. Beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon aromas of blackcurrant and spice dominate the bouquet. Medium-bodied on the palate with silky tannins, a bright acidity and a good structure. Blackcurrant, liquorice and dark chocolate flavours all in a wrap with great finesse. There's great ageing potential in this extremely fine red.<br><br>60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot. The grapes come from the vines of Château Smith Haut Lafitte, a single block on a Günz gravel plateau in the Pessac-Léognan appellation.<br>Harvest is done by hand. Grapes go through sorting twice, before and after destemming. Next is optical sorting before the berries gently drop without crushing into both wooden and stainless steel vats for fermentation. Pumping over during fermentation to extract tannins and colour. The wine ages for 14 months in wooden barrels (20% new) from their in-house cooperage.

The first nose provides an aromatically intense and complex bouquet of sun-ripened citrus fruits and  white flowers. After a little swirling, notes of white peach and gooseberries open with a hint of exoticism. Aromatic citrus determines the palate. The white Bordeaux wine is very elegant and fresh, at the same time round and balanced, with beautiful fullness of juicy fruit and discreetly integrated oak wood.In the finale fresh, concentrated and smooth with notes of grapefruit and delicate spice. 70% Sauvignon Blanc, 10% Sauvignon Gris, 10% Muscadelle, 10% Sémillion</div>
<div class=""column""></div>
<div class=""column"">In the cool hours of the morning, the  grapes are picked selectively and by hand. A gentle pressing follows in the basement. The must is pre-clarified by natural sedimentation. At controlled temperatures, the clear must was then fermented partly in a stainless steel tank (80%), partly in new barriques and the wines were finally aged for five months in a stainless steel tank.<br>Château Clarke is one of the rare vineyards in the Médoc that produce a white wine. The Merle Blanc is part of the history and heritage of the Château, as it has been produced since the late 19th century (1890). Highly respected and renowned, it has accounted for up to a quarter of the Château’s production. Today, this rare wine fits perfectly into the spirit of the estate.<br>

David Franz Loan Vineyard Sémillon Naturel has a very bright pale straw colour with hints of pale apple green. Fleshy ripe lemon and lime over summer grass all comfortably resting on a subtle savory bread-dough and cashew nut underlay. On the palate, waxed lemon citrus curd vies with textural mouth-filling golden brioche while honeyed oak evokes late Autumn and endless days. Textural fleshy mouth wraps seductively around a very Semillon center of poised acidity. The counterbalance of gentle assertive acid &amp; generous fruit are framed with softly drying, very long finish.

These machines, using a “big balloon”, press the grapes gently, releasing high quality must.<br>For the varieties Malagousia and Chardonnay, pressing is usually preceded by a pre-fermentation maceration step. In this case, the must stays in contact with the skins for 12 hours at a low temperature and under carbon dioxide, in order to extract certain compounds from the grape skins. It is these compounds that later will define significantly the aroma and the flavor of the wine.<br>Alcoholic fermentation takes place in stainless steel tanks under controlled temperature. For each variety a different temperature may be selected, so that the varietal aromas are better expressed and maintained. It normally lasts between 15 and 20 days. During this period, the must’s sweetness gives way to the distinctive wine flavor while wonderful aromas fill up the place.</div>

<br><a href=""https://www.millaman.cl/?lang=en"">Millaman Reserve Carmenere</a> has a deep red colour with purple hints. It has intense notes of sweet and spicy tones and subsequently opens up to the aromas of ripe red fruits. The complex layering of the bouquet finally reaches the soft notes of white pepper, tobacco and cocoa. It has soft and ripe tannins, that are round on the palate. This savoury red has a good balance that complements the acidity and has a long and persistent finish.<br>The terroir of the vineyard produces a wine with dense colour and good concentration of aromas, dominated by ripe red fruits, spices and a balanced acidity. The valley’s meso-climatic conditions ensure a good, naturally healthy, vineyard.<br>100% Carmenere. The grapes are carefully hand-picked during the last week of April. They were then destemmed and gently pressed for a long cold maceration with prolonged contact with the skin. Selected yeasts were used for the fermentation. The temperatures were moderated for a gentle extraction of tannins, this way we maintain fruit and freshness of the wine. Complete malolactic fermentation. The wine is then aged in French oak, of which some are new.<br>Check out the <a href=""https://www.boundbywine.com/product/millaman-limited-reserve-barrel-aged-malbec/"">Malbec Limited Reserve</a> from Millaman Winery.<br>

<br><div>This wine is a dream come true. Our entire family had wished for the Tenuta Perano, and from this estate we chose the Rialzi vineyard, which rises above the others on three natural steps, characteristic of the area, for this wine. A Gran Selezione which, as the name suggests, reminds me of our continual commitment to excellence every day.</div>
<br>
</div>
<br>
</div>
<br>
</div><br>After meticulous work in the vineyard, the Sangiovese grapes were carefully hand-picked. Once they arrived at the cellar, they were carefully selected once again. Fermentation took place in stainless steel vats at a controlled temperature with maceration on the skins and careful pump-overs to ensure the best possible phenolic extraction. Afterwards, the wine was aged for 36 months, 24 of which spent in barriques. Only after a further period spent ageing in bottles was Rialzi Chianti Classico Gran Selezione ready to be released into the market.<br><div class=""_1S6Bb active"">

<br>The 2016 season at the Tenuta Perano estate saw a harsh winter period with considerable precipitation, including snow. Winter was followed by a mild spring. The warm spring days woke the plants from their winter slumber, resulting in even sprouting, which began around 20 April, and excellent leaf growth. By the first week of June, flowering had begun. The hot, sunny and breezy summer days provided the perfect conditions for photosynthesis. Veraison led to the Tenuta Perano bunches changing colour in August, a month that saw two beneficial periods of rainfall, resulting in perfectly ripe and succulent fruit. Beginning in mid-October, the outstanding harvest of exceptional Sangiovese grapes was brought to the cellar. 2016 produced a truly extraordinary wine, both in terms of its aromatic intensity and rich structure.<br>

<a href=""https://www.frescobaldi.com/en/wines/tenuta-perano-riserva"">Tenuta Perano Chianti Riserva</a> immediately presents a brilliant ruby ​​red colour with violet reflections. Its bouquet is complex and intense. Floral scents, ranging from sweet violet to dog-rose immediately pervade the nose; fruity notes soon make their entrance, recalling blackcurrant and blueberry. Over time, the emphasis shifts to tertiary notes evoking nutmeg and black pepper, as well as cocoa powder. A balsamic sensation gives infinite elegance to the wine. It surprises in the mouth with its freshness, persistence and length. The tannic texture is dense, as is appropriate for Sangiovese from the most suitable soils. It closes with hints of noble tobacco and leather. The finish is long and harmonious.<br>

<div>In the heart of Chianti Classico, nestled within a natural amphitheater facing southwest, exceptionally unique soil and climate conditions exist for the production of this Riserva Chianti Classico. Here, five hundred meters above sea level, the Tenuta Perano vineyards in Gaiole in Chianti offer all the characteristics for Sangiovese to find its most elegant and personable expression. Fruit of a careful handpicked selection, the wine is aged in Slavonia oak barrels for 24 months.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<br>The history of this wine was born above all in the vineyard, where altitude, exposure and slope contribute to the elegance and expressiveness of the grapes. Once harvested by hand and carefully selected, they are fermented in stainless steel tanks at a controlled temperature. Frequently breaking up the cap allows for a perfect polyphenolic extraction able to determine the typical colour and structure of a Chianti Classico Riserva. The prolonged period of maturation in wood certainly contributes to the structural intensity of this wine, further aged in the bottle for a period. At the end of this period, Tenuta Perano Riserva 2016 is ready to make its début on the scene.

<br>A harsh climate rich in rainfall characterised the winter of 2016, with intense frosts and snow. Sprouting was regular and arrived in the second half of April, in line with the timing of this phenological stage. Mild spring temperatures favoured the development of the surface of the leaves, gently accompanying the flowering vines in the first week of June. The hot, sunny, breezy summer days created the best possible opportunity for photosynthesis. Veraison saw the Tenuta Perano bunches change colour in the month of August, a period during which two beneficial rains occurred, allowing the grapes to achieve perfect ripeness and succulence. 2016 bestowed a series of extraordinary wines, both in the intensity of their aromas and their noble structure.</div>

The spring thaw and rising temperatures allowed the vines to sprout as usual. The mild temperatures and some spring rain caused the foliage to form quickly with a nice extended surface. The vines bloomed during the first week of June, with sunny days and temperatures that fostered a good fruit setting. Veraison took place around 10 August thanks to optimal conditions of heat during the day mitigated by good night ventilation. The splendid vintage is attributed to the hot summer, marked by rain storms in July and in early August. The harvest began on 10 September, with grapes of exceptional health and quality.

<a href=""https://www.jimbarry.com/wine/2021-assyrtiko"">Jim Barry Assyrtiko</a> has a vibrant pale straw colour in the glass. It opens with lifted floral aromas, followed by notes of pear and lime. This Assyrtiko shows great flavour concentration, with a flinty streak of minerality running through its core. The crisp and refreshing line of acidity gives the wine a lively feel. It finishes with a fine chalky texture with a nice length.</div>
<div class=""column"">
<br>The one and only Assyrtiko in Australia is currently is being produced by the iconic Barry family Clare Valley. This crisp white variety, native to the island of Santorini, was imported by Peter Barry in 2006 and is now finally in full production.</div>
<div class=""column"">
<br>It's a crunchy, stony and minerally wine that is produced from these grapes. Peter Barry had a gut feeling it would have potential in the Clare Valley. A few vintages in and that instinct is proving right.</div>
<div class=""column"">
<br>Let's hear it from the winemaker:<br>""I first tasted Assyrtiko in August 2006 while on holiday with my wife Sue on the Greek island of Santorini, birthplace of the Assyrtiko grape variety. The crisp, acidic qualities reminded me of our Clare Valley Rieslings and yet it was a flavour I had not experienced before. Intrigued with this newfound variety, I began the process of importing cuttings into Australia through quarantine. In August 2012 we planted Australia’s first Assyrtiko at our Lodge Hill Vineyard, a special and unique site treasured by my family and suited to this variety. Our Assyrtiko journey has been fascinating and has enabled us to produce a wine which, I believe, is a true expression of the variety. I hope you find the flavours as interesting as I did in 2006.”</div>

The pergola style vineyard has a semi-arid climate and soils that are predominantly alluvial with deep sandy texture.<br>Manual harvest of the grapes with strict selection. After a careful destemming, the fruit soaks in water briefly for more colour and flavour extraction. A gentle pressing follows and the juice is left to rest in cool temperatures to allow the coarser components to settle. The clean juice undergoes spontaneous alcoholic fermentation over 3 weeks with wild yeasts in temperature-controlled (14–16°C) stainless steel tanks. The young wine then moves to used French oak barriques for malolactic fermentation and ages in the same barrels for 6 months.

Brewing sake since 1637. Japan's tradition of sake making began more than 2,000 years ago shortly after rice cultivation was introduced from China.

The difference is that sake rice has lesser fats and protein contents but more starch contents compared to table rice. And this difference is key in producing premium sakes.<br>

This pure and classy blanc has an excellent balance between fullness and acidity. Superb to the last drop with surprising flavours of hazelnut and Comté.<br><br>The Jura vineyards cover 1865Ha along a north-south axis, stretching from Salins-les-Bains to Saint-Amour. This strip of land is bounded on the east by the first limestone plateau of the Jura Mountains and on the west, by the plain of Bresse. In front, towards the west stretches in the same axis, Burgundy. They only produce white wine with Savagin and Chardonnay under the Protected Designation of Origin (AOP) Arbois and Côtes-du-Jura. We are looking for the right expression of terroir.<br>Ageing begins on the lees without any stirring to preserve the purity of the structure. The wine spent 16 months ageing in the barrel.</div>
<div class=""column"">
<br>Savagnin, not to be confused with Sauvignon Blanc, is a wine grape with a long history that is today arguably most famous for producing ‘vin jaune’ in Jura, eastern France. While the debate of its origins is ongoing, Savagnin is today best known as the signature grape of Jura.<br>

Beginning with a gorgeous white peach and passion fruit on the nose, followed by pears and peaches. It finishes with a saline salty freshness. The resulting wine is beautifully balanced and precise. It is true to its origins, with a classical fine linear textural focus but a bright and bristling, prominent acidity. The long, saline finish will keep you coming back for more. I know it already sounds irresistible, but you gotta try and keep a few bottles back for ageing. This lovely white has an ageing potential of 10+ years. (Great things are worth the wait).<br><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-12277 aligncenter"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/line-e1590996348338-300x30.png?v=1642666597"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""30""><br>Arriving in South Africa during the 1920’s, Colombard (or Colombar as pronounced by some locals), became a variety that few talk about yet many (knowingly or unknowingly) often drink some form of it. Mostly used as a blending grape (or to produce Brandy or Cognac), Colombard’s neutral character opens itself up to a<br>variety of personalities. But when the vines are planted in the right place and have been in the ground for long enough, Colombard becomes a mirror reflecting its terroir. This is when the grape is really able to shine.<br><em>Winemaker’s note: “I believe that old vineyards have their own story to tell, and Colombard is no exception. My job is to bottle that story.”</em><br>Picked in small crates, from the truck and straight into whole-bunch pressing. Natural fermentation started after about 3 days. Thereafter wine was kept on the lees for as long as possible, because that is where the “magic” happens as complex flavours and texture develops. Because nature has already done the work, the winemaking process is kept as natural as possible with minimal interference.<br>Give this <a href=""https://www.boundbywine.com/product/bouchard-finlayson-missionvale-chardonnay-2017/"">Chardonnay</a> from South Africa a go!<br>

<br>100% Sauvignon Blanc from Awatere Valley vineyards on both the north and south of the river. This reflects the different soil fertility and flavour these sites contribute.

<br>Machine harvesting of the grapes at night or in the cool parts of the day to preserve the purity and intensity of flavours. Next is de-stemming and a light pressing with minimal skin contact.

The climate is semi-arid and windy, with cold winters and warm summers. The vineyards have deep silty loam soils, which allow great vineyard development.<br>

<br>After hand-picking the fruit into 300kg bins, they go through a manual selection at the winery to ensure final product quality. The must ferments in small tanks under optimum conditions to preserve the characteristics and qualities of the terroir. Alcoholic fermentation and later maceration last around 20 days. 40% of the wine ages for 6 months in French oak barrels and the rest remain un-oaked to highlight the fruit flavours and aromas, and to maintain its soft and silky tannins. Slight filtering using cartridges before bottling.<br>

Honeydew, lime and lychee-scented nose that also reveals hints of wild asparagus and fresh lemon verbena. On the palate, this extroverted wine is lively, fresh, and gentle. The quintessential Sauvignon Blanc. This wine is best enjoyed in its youth, within 2-3 years after bottling.<br><br>Los Vascos’ Sauvignon Blanc is made from grapes purchased on long term contracts with growers in the Casablanca Valley. The vintages all offer very pure fruit and a lively, refreshing palate.<br>This season started with a mild winter, no risk of frost in September and October and very few below 0ºC events. Mornings were remarkably humid in spring and summer, a signature characteristic of the Casablanca valley due to its proximity to the Pacific Ocean (18 km as the crow flies). It should be noted that these conditions led to high phytosanitary pressure ; however, strict control allowed us to harvest very healthy fruit. Since this season was slightly cooler compared to last year, evolution and sugar accumulation were slower. Consequently, wines are lower in alcohol content but boast a fresher character, delicious acidity, and perfect balance.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0684/6336/2367/products/losvascos-sb.jpg?v=1690805450,BBW-WINE-269,21.0000000000

White flowers, lychee and passion fruit dominate the nose whilst a touch of lime and white pepper creates a beautiful freshness. A frank and chiseled attack on an elegant palate. Full and silky mouthfeel with a light fruit sweetness and fresh zingy acidity. Grapefruit, bitter orange and lime citrus flavours emerge with stoney minerality, a hint of white blossoms and a touch of exotic fruit. Dry and crisp with a lean finish.<br>

Rose comes on towards the back of the palate, with florals on the back of the throat and hints of stone fruit. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The finish is where you start to get some acidic, wine-like notes as well as the standard dry out with a touch of angelica, sage, thyme and bitter orange zest.</span><br><br><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Recipe of our Riesling-Infused Ferdinand's Saar Dry Gin is an homage to the fruitful landscape of the Saar-Region.

1554,Ferdinand's Saar Quince,8596538917183,Quince,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><a href=""https://www.ferdinandsgin.com/#products"">Ferdinand's Saar Quince</a> is a fruity, and tarty quince, coming across almost Damonesque. If the goal was to create a sloe gin with something other than sloes, mission accomplished. In blind testing, you might mistake Ferdinand’s Saar Quince for a sloe gin. Jammy, with thick plum/ripe sour cherry notes, some prickly gin-like notes coming through. There’s a bit of juniper, albeit quite sedate. It has notes of </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">ginger, herbs, slight bits of rose and bobs of vanilla. The good (or bad) news is that it doesn’t come across as an overwhelmingly fruity gin at first. A sprinkling of coriander in there as well, cassia/ginger spice notes towards the finish, with the sweetness and good balance from some lightly acidic. The wine notes also seem most concentrated on the finish, where stone fruit and tart quince linger, sweetly on the palate. </span><br><br><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Freshly harvested Muscat quinces, a rare Pear Quince strain, growing behind the distillery as well as an infusion of our Rausch Kabinett are the basis for our regional homage to the british Sloe Gin. Featuring 30 botanicals, Ferdinand Saar Gin is already something of a beast. It combines common botanicals (angelica, coriander, ginger), less common, but still regularly seen ones (lavender, rose) and then there’s those which are really unusual (sloe, rarely seen as a botanical, lemon thyme) – but wait! It’s then cut with Riesling wine (Germany, kind of known for that). And in the case of the Ferdinand’s Saar Quince, it’s a Sloe gin homage, using the local quince grown right at the distillery, with a touch of sweetening. It’s a lovely golden hue.</span>",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0684/6336/2367/products/Ferdinands-Quince.jpg?v=1690805517,BBW-SPRT-016,99.0000000000

Mirabeau has used a 100% grape-based neutral spirit which adds roundness and subtle fruitiness to the palate. Lemons and Coriander add layers of fresh citrus character.

And meant to be a limited edition. Till we realised how stonking it was. If anyone tells you making rhubarb gin is fun, they’re blatantly doing it wrong. You have to throttle tonnes and tonnes of the stuff to get enough juice. Even then, you don’t know what colour your final batch will have. All thanks to pectin, a volatile component that – look, just trust us. It’s a total faff.

Incredible depth on the complex nose releases aromas of black fruit, sweet tobacco and vanilla. Full-bodied and dry, the palate reveals great balance, a pleasant freshness as well as ripe and firm tannins. Rich blackberry and blackcurrant fruit flavours with endless layers of coffee, tobacco, chocolate and oak spice. Closes in a powerful and long finish.

Semi-concealed in the foothills near Bolgheri, Ornellaia lies just a few kilometres from the Mediterranean coast. During the summer months, the cool sea breeze caresses the vineyards and nearby olive groves, whilst the hills provide protection from the cold north winds in winter. Ornellaia believes that a wine should be the most authentic expression of the unique terroir it originates from. The maritime climate, the heterogeneous nature of the land and the estate – of marine, alluvial and volcanic origin – creates a distinct environment where red and white varieties can best express themselves.<br>
</div>
<div class=""column""></div>
<div class=""column"">The cuvée is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot from Ornellaia's vineyards. Manual harvesting of the different varietals then double sorting selection, destemming and a soft crushing. The vinification of each grape variety and single vineyard block occurs separately. Fermentation in stainless steel and concrete tanks at temperatures below 25°C for a week. Next is a 10–15 day maceration period. Malolactic fermentation takes place in oak barrels, 70% new and 30% second fill. The wine then remains in barriques and ages for about 18 months in Ornellaia's temperature-controlled cellars. After the first 12 months of maturation, the wine is assembled and then returned to the barriques for an additional 6 months. After bottling, the wine ages for a further 12 months before release.<br>

In order to achieve low yields the vineyard is non-irrigated and cane-pruned. Picking time for the Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon is usually around early March. The fruit is ripened to approximately 12° baume, but this is not recipe winemaking and fruit flavour ultimately determines picking dates. The fruit is then handpicked and transported to the winery (adjacent to the vines) on the Picardy estate.<br>Approximately 10% of the Sauvignon Blanc is whole bunch pressed and the remainder is destemmed and pressed. The juice is settled for 48 hours before being racked and the fermentation commenced. The fermentation is carried out using two different yeast strains to give fruit complexity and texture. The wine is then given a gentle filtration on its way to bottle.<br>

Aromas of citrus and minerality lead to a brilliant refreshing finish. The invigorating acidity and bright texture give this bottle a fine balance and immediate attraction.<br>
</div>
<br>This white is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc hailing from two types of terriors – marls and stony calcareous “caillottes”, which enhances the wine’s complexity. The finesse and fruit from the “caillottes”wines are complemented by the power and length of the marls. This wine has an ageing potential of 3 – 15 years to express all of its complexity.</div>
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<br>The grapes undergo immediate pneumatic press and cold settlement between 48 – 72h. This is to protect the fruits against deterioration of aromas and eliminate vegetal fragments and dusts. The aromas and complexity is developed through long fermentation by natural yeasts with temperature control. Ageing on heavy lees of fermentation until the first racking which occurred between February and April. Fining and filtration before bottling and stocked for two months before release.<br>

<br>The vineyard lies on red clay soils with a sandy loam texture on the surface, turning to clay loam 70–180 centimetres below. The soil is deep and has good drainage. The vineyards experience a warm, arid climate with cold nights and plenty of rain. The vines withstand the temperatures well and the dryness of the inland climate provides them with good conditions.<br>After picking and sorting the grapes, they enter 16 days of maceration. Fermentation lasts for 10 days at 24°C with alcoholic fermentation in stainless steel tanks and malolactic fermentation in French oak barrels. Following fermentation, the wine ages for 14 months in French oak barrels, 34% new and 66% second-fill.<br><strong>Ageing potential:</strong> 10–20 years.<br> <br>

<br>100% Syrah. The fruit comes from Old Road Wine's Pepperwind vineyard, a single vineyard on a cool site on the eastern slopes of the Franschhoek mountains with exposure to cool afternoon breezes. These south easterly breezes are instrumental in the 'peppery' characteristic of the wine.<br>Hand harvesting the fruit in small bins at optimal ripeness. The grapes receive extended skin contact for optimal colour and flavour extraction before their racking to barrels for fermentation. After primary fermentation, the wine undergoes malolactic fermentation in the same barrels. Finally, the wine ages for 18 months in the same second and third fill French oak barrels.<br>

And although the majority is still Cabernet Sauvignon (67%), the influence of the franc is tremendous, filling the nose of this wine with tobacco and herbal notes. But there is also more freshness here, more than in the first years. You feel more red fruit, more tension, more strength in acidity. The last time I was in VIK, we had the chance to taste all the years available in the winery (already finished wines) from 2010 to 2016, and the changes continue towards fresher wines. This 2013 is just the beginning of a small revolution.<br><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-33233"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/Wine-Pages-1024x200-1-300x59.jpg?v=1642771781"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""59""> <strong> - 94 POINTS</strong><br><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-12857"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/22.png?v=1642667103"" alt="""" width=""60"" height=""54""> (2021) The most expensive wine of the tasting at £100 per bottle, this is a Bordeaux blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Cabernet Franc, 14% Carmenere and a touch of Merlot. It comes from an ambitious young estate started just over a decade ago by Alex and Carrie Vik. The wine spends 23 months in a new French oak barrels. Winemaker Cristian Vallejo explains the estate has followed a quality path since day one, with very dense plantings of varieties researched to suit each of the 12 valleys spanned by their estate. They are even planning to use barrels from their own oak forest, and amphorae made from clay found on the estate. Great creamy depth here, a little hint of olive and then dry, savoury black fruit, some tobbaco and more exotic spices, but mostly about the fruit. In the mouth truly sumptuous, with great fruit sweetness and creaminess across the mid-palate, concentrated, but with lovely cherry-fresh juiciness, creamy tannins too, but the oak just caressing and supporting rather than dominating the picture. Very impressive.<br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-10457"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/Wine-Spectator-92-300x300.png?v=1642749160"" alt="""" width=""177"" height=""177""><br><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-12857"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/22.png?v=1642667103"" alt="""" width=""60"" height=""54""> Powerful and well-structured, with medium-grained tannins and firm acidity supporting the plum and dried berry flavors.

In the mouth, this is saturated, chewy and dense. Baked berry, black plum, cocoa and baking spice flavors finish steady but a touch flat. This is an excellent Chilean red by all standards, but one with limitations. Drink through 2025.<br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-22837"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/robert-parker.png?v=1642763898"" alt="""" width=""160"" height=""160""><br><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-12857"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/22.png?v=1642667103"" alt="""" width=""60"" height=""54""> They used more Cabernet Franc in the cooler 2013 vintage for the blend of their flagship 2013 Vik, which for the first time does not contain any Syrah. It's 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Cabernet Franc, 13% Carmenere and 2% Merlot that matured in 100% new barriques for 23 months. It's 13.7% alcohol. However, I feel like the wine comes from a different oenological era, as there is a little more rusticity and more influence from the oak in the wine as well as quite high ripeness or sensation of ripeness in the fruit. In fact, when I asked about it, winemaker Cristian Vallejo explained that he calls 2013 ""the year of change,"" when he understood the difference of their Cabernets with those from other regions. However, I think the change is more noticeable in 2014, as I tasted the 2014 next to this 2013. 54,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in October 2016.</div>

<br>An amphora is a two-handled ancient Greek storage jar or vase with a large oval body, narrow cylindrical neck and pointed bottom. The characteristic size and shape allows them to fit tightly against each other in storage rooms and packages. Vast numbers of amphorae, tied together with rope, could be used to store and deliver various products (mostly wine) by land or sea. Due to a collective desire for unique wines from unexpected places, the amphora wine style has gained popularity over the last decade or so.<br>The porous nature of clay in these vessels exposes the wine to some air, fostering an interesting and attractive set of flavours. These clay vessels uphold the purity of fruit and its curved nature encourages even ageing on the lees (the spent yeast cells and flavour-giving gunk at the bottom). As the wine world seeks to mimic ancient ways, it's no wonder the amphora train is racing full speed into the future.</div>

Wines produced from these soils tend to be deep in colour and are very concentrated and bring loads of mid-palate to any blend.<br>Each parcel of grapes is chilled in a cold room then 90% added as whole bunches to tank and the remainder is added destemmed. Minimal SO2 is added and, as with all our wines, no further additions are made. The must is initially pigeaged once a day. After about 4 days, fermentation begins with indigenous yeasts and the wine is pigeaged once or twice a day, depending on extract and tannin development. Temperatures are kept below 28 °C. Fermentation lasts 7 to 10 days after which 3 to 7 weeks (also depending on tannin development) skin contact is given. The wine is then pressed to barrel for malolactic fermentation and maturation. Each parcel is racked in Spring to blend the wine. The wine is then aged for 11 months in 225 and 500 litre French oak barrels, 15% of which are new, and a 2,000 litre foudre. Finally the wine is bottled unfiltered, unrefined and with a minimum amount of sulphur.<br>Check out other <a href=""https://boundbywine.com/product/thorne-and-daughters-tin-soldier-semillon-2019/"">Whites</a> from Thorne and Daughters also from South Africa.<br>

After giving renowned painter Javier de Aubeyzon a bottle of this pure Millahue character, they set him free to bring La Piu Belle Rosé to life. Paintbrush to canvas, he was guided by the spirit of a mysterious woman and this wine’s pulse, now one and the same.<br>A face came first, ethereal beauty radiating, La Piu Belle’s vibrance in human form. Beautiful bouquets surround her to create a balance between tenderness and intensity, to soften her enigmatic force. La Piu Belle goes beyond the bottle. She represents the energy among the vines, the power within VIK's grapes and the allure of this Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc Rosé blend. She is the essence of VIK, their new Art piece.<br>A label that reflects the beauty of all women. A face with unique features, a mix of different women around the world.<br>The project took almost 2 years, starting with a canvas, then painted on a bottle and finally was made into a sleeve.<br> <br>

Exceptionally aromatic bouquet of morello cherry and pepper spice. Smooth mouthfeel with a delicate structure and silky, melting tannins. A fruity attack of ripe red berries, cherries and a touch of vanilla. Closes with a crisp finish.<br>

<br>100% Pinot Noir. The fruit comes from a Côte Chalonnaise village that takes it name from the God of Merchants, Mercury. The story goes that a temple was erected here in honour of this deity. A Roman road called ‘la voie Agrippa’ (Agrippa’s Road) crosses through Mercurey, which in Roman times linked Chalon-sur-Saône to Autun. Today, Mercurey is one of the largest wine regions in Bourgogne with over 600 hectares of vines. The Faiveley vineyard here has a south-eastern exposure and clay-limestone soils. These old vines were planted in 1962, 1978, 1981.<br>

<div class=""column"">The grapes go through harvesting and sorting by hand. A portion of destemmed grapes and whole clusters are used to create the wines. Pumping over twice daily to extract colour, tannins and aromas from the skin of the grapes to the wines. After a 15–19 day vatting period, the alcoholic fermentation is complete. The free-run wine is run off using a gravity system, whilst the marc presses slowly and gently in order to extract an exceptionally pure press wine. The wine ages for 12 months in French oak barrels (10% of which are new oak). These barrels were specially selected for their fine grain and moderate toast. Finally, the wines are left to age in the Domaine Faiveley cellars at consistent, natural hygrometry and temperature.</div>

<div class=""column"">100% Sémillon. The grapes come from a single very special 80-year-old bushvine vineyard. These old vines were born in 1936. The vineyard has a high density of around 7,000 vines per hectare. This is more than double the amount of vines per hectare in comparison to the average vineyard in SA. The south-east facing vineyard has an altitude of 350 metres and very low-yielding vines.<br>Two batches of harvesting by hand to achieve a perfect balance in ripeness. The grapes are left on the skins to settle overnight. Following this, 70% of the juice is inoculated with a specially selected yeast strain and the remaining 30% goes through wild fermentation. After fermentation, the wine undergoes barrel maturation in mostly older French oak barrels. This adds depth and staying power without detracting from the natural fruit character. Maturation on the primary lees with regular stirring or batonnage ensures further complexity and verve.<br>

<br>Phinney’s simplest bottle design is used for his most expensive wine: Mercury Head. The inspiration for the botte's design came when Phinney chanced upon a Liberty dime in a handful of small change.<br>“It reminded me of how much I enjoyed collecting coins as a kid. The Liberty dime, affectionately known as ‘Mercury head’, was always my favourite,” says Phinney. The coins haven’t been in production since 1945, but that didn’t deter him from his idea of sticking a Liberty dime to the front of every bottle of Mercury Head.<br>“It took a little effort at first to find the dimes from dealers and coin collectors, but we have a good supply now. People even send us the coins from their empty bottles to use,” says Phinney.<br>

<br>Thanks to his love for wood, their ancestor Etienne (known as Henri) was the first in Sancerre to make a wine in new oak barrels. Such a method of vinification requires top-quality grapes for a successful marriage of wood and wine. Alcoholic fermentation is exclusively in oak barrels that are either new, 1-, or 2-years-old. Following this, the wine matures in barrels for 12 months.</div>

The range of terrain, climate and free-draining soil has earned Hawke's Bay its reputation as a quality wine-growing region. Estate Vineyards was launched in 2012 as a collection of five varietally-designated wines that represent the best qualities of Te Mata's grape varieties, vintages and Hawke's origin.</span><br>Separate parcels of fully ripened Syrah grapes were hand-harvested from Te Mata Estate’s Vineyards between 4 – 12 April 2016.The individual lots were each destemmed and given a traditional warm-plunged fermentation. The resulting wines underwent extended maceration on skins before pressing and then a secondary malolactic fermentation. The separate wines were then run to a mixture of new and seasoned French oak barriques for 15 months’ maturation. During this time, they were regularly topped and racked, before egg-white fining, blending and then bottling in September 2017.<br>Vineyard partners Michael Morris and Peter Cowley named Bullnose after an early Morris Cowley car, nicknamed Bullnose due to its distinctive radiator. The bull emblem that appears on the label is drawn from the car’s radiator crest. Since 1905, this winery has been winning gold medals globally, which led to these sites becoming the country’s first to be protected by law due to their viticultural history...Te Mata Estate wines are currently available in 45 countries and have been presented at some of the world’s top tables— including to President Barrack Obama, President Xi Jinping, and Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee.""<br>Give <a href=""https://boundbywine.com/product/recanati-upper-galilee-syrah-2019/"">Syrah</a> from Upper Galilee (Israel) a try!<br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12411"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/alcohol-1-300x300.png?v=1642666758"" alt="""" width=""69"" height=""69"">13%<br> <br><h4 class=""p text ""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>AWARD &amp; ACCOLADES</strong></span></h4><br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-16376"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/JR-e1599450923482-300x91.png?v=1642752661"" alt="""" width=""211"" height=""64""><br><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-12857"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/22.png?v=1642667103"" alt="""" width=""60"" height=""54"">Confected black fruit, finely layered tannins, a touch of bacon and smoke on the finish.

<div class=""page"" title=""Page 1"">
<br>
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">Pale straw colour with green reflections. Like a “Grand Cru”, the terroir of Pouilly gives a richness and a complex aromatic palate to this wine. The bouquet is full of green and white fruits with a grassy element of herbs, white flowers and white pepper. A lively acidity and the (chalky and flinty) mineral notes are balanced by delicious flavours of lime citrus, ripe pear, quince and green plum fruit. Very nice structure on the palate and gorgeous persistence on the finish.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<br>100% Sauvignon Blanc. Made from a strict selection of the best Sauvignon grapes, the fruit for La Demoiselle comes from the Kimmeridgian marls of Saint-Laurent l'Abbaye. The first vines of this AOC were planted in this location. This terroir gives roundness, deepness and a great longevity to the wines.
<div class=""page"" title=""Page 1"">
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">
<br>After a gentle pressing and 24 hours settling, fermentation for 85% of the must occurs in thermo-regulated stainless steel tanks at 15–18°C. The remaining 15% goes through fermentation in 600 litre oak barrels. This subtle blending gives a great complexity to the wine. Maturation takes place on fine lees for 9–10 months before bottling.</div>

<br>100% Sauvignon Blanc. Made from old Sauvignon vines growing in silex soils on slopes first worked by the monks of Saint-Satur. Historically, these plots had the name ""Les Bourgeoises"". In the 80s, the new cuvée made from this selection of parcels inherits this name. Flinty soils give the wines a great minerality, intensity and an excellent ageing potential.

<div class=""column"">Arguably Australia's leading cult Shiraz. <a href=""https://www.rockfordwines.com.au"">Rockford</a> Basket Press Shiraz 2016 is a classic worth seeking out and cellaring.<br>
</div>
<div class=""column""><strong></strong></div>
<div class=""column"">
<strong>Wine varietal and region: </strong>100% Shiraz. Made from specially selected small parcels of old, dry-grown  Barossa Shiraz from nearly 30 of the Barossa’s finest grape growing families. The vineyards are in different sub-regions throughout the Barossa, which adds to the complexity and depth of the final blend. The wine is handmade using equipment from the turn of the last century. It then ages in seasoned American and French oak casks for 2 years.</div>
<div class=""column""><strong></strong></div>
<div class=""column"">
<strong>Taste profile: </strong>Deep garnet colour. Opens with an earthy nose that broadens to include underlying notes of espresso, dark chocolate, nuts and a hint of blackberry preserve. The medium-bodied palate has a firm structure, chewy tannins and a crisp acidity. Impressive length too. All of this supports a ripe concentration of red berry fruit, earthy and mocha flavours that close with a pleasant muscular fruit and dried herb finish.<br>

Those in the know understand that the 2015 vintage in the Barossa was a stunner. It's likely that the 2015 Rockford Basket Press is even better than the 2014, if such a thing is possible!</span><br>

<br>100% organically grown Pinot Noir grapes. This wine comes from their best plots of Pinot Noir vines, using minimal sulfur and avoiding filtration. The wine ages for 16 months in French oak, 80% new. Following this, the wine sees additional bottle ageing until it is ready for release.<br>There are two soil types in the Helan Mountain Eastern Foothills wine region: Sierozem and Eolian. Sierozem, a desert soil, is characterized by brownish gray color at the surface and lighter color below, and is based in a carbonate or hardpan layer. Different ratios of gravel, sand and clay within the Sierozem soil account for variations across wineries in the area. Eolian soil is made of wind deposited materials that consist primarily of sand or silt-sized particles. Silver Heights’ vineyards are all on Sierozem soil, with a high concentration of gravel.<br>One unique viticultural feature of the region is the practice of burying the vines under 30 cm (12 inches) of earth to protect them during the harsh, freezing winters.<br>Is Silver Heights piquing your interest?

<a href=""https://www.zenato.it/en/"">Zenato</a> Ripassa Valpolicella Ripasso DOC Superiore is the king of baby Amarone. As soon as the dried grapes for the winery’s Amarone have completed fermentation, a top selection of Valpolicella grapes “passes over” (ripassa) the Amarone pomace, thus resulting in a second brief fermentation.<br>Deep ruby red colour. The nose opens with aromas of black cherries, red plums, strawberries and a hint of dried fruit. The full-bodied palate has a velvety texture, good structure and soft acidity. Juicy black cherry and red plum fruit flavours with hints of dried figs, rum pot, coffee, liquorice and baking spices. Closes in a long and noble finale.<br>

<br>85% Corvina, 10% Rondinella, 5% Oseleta. The grapes for this wine come from vineyards in Sant’Ambrogio di Valpolicella, on the hills of the Classic area. The vineyards sit on an altitude of 250–300 metres with a southeastern and southwestern exposure. The vines have an average age of 10–15 years and grow in mostly limey-clay soils with a guyot training system.<br>After destemming the grapes, maceration begins in stainless steel fermenters for 10–12 days. After <span class=""xwhighlight"" data-hasqtip=""11"" aria-describedby=""qtip-11"">alcoholic</span> fermentation, light pressing separates the skin from the new wine, which moves to large oak casks of 54 and 75 hectolitres until February; this is the period in which the <span class=""xwhighlight"" data-hasqtip=""12"">dried</span> grapes are pressed to produce Amarone. At this point, the Valpolicella is passed over the marc of the Amarone for a period of 7–8 days at a temperature of 25–28°C. The wine then ages for 18 months in oak barrels and 6 months in bottles.<br>

The beautiful Spring weather which followed which led to good flowering/fruit set and improved yields for most varieties in the region. Fine, warm weather during Summer saw sugar accumulation accelerate quickly in the whites, until a significant rain event mid-January stalled the ripening process until the fine weather returned soon after. While the unusual January rain did present some challenges in the vineyard, it was certainly welcomed by the reds which were just beginning veraison. The warm, dry weather throughout February was fantastic, ensuring the whites achieved flavour ripeness and enabling the reds to attain flavour and tannin ripeness at full physiological maturity. Fruit for this blend was predominantly Estate grown (85%) on our Boodjudup and Stevens Road vineyards in the Wallcliffe sub-region of Margaret River, complimented by a portion (15%) of fruit from a mature vineyard in Karridale.<br>The fruit was destemmed and then crushed with open rollers to introduce whole berries into the ferment. After fermentation in both static and rotary fermenters, the various batches underwent MLF and 14 months maturation in a selection of fine French oka barriques (25% new) prior to assembling the blend and bottling. Perfectly approachable in its youth, this wine will also sit comfortably in your cellar for several years.<br>

A smaller parcel of the Entav 52 clone (known for its small bunch and berry size) was grown at Riverbrook Vineyard in Rapaura, in young alluvial soils containing high proportions of greywacke river stones. The vineyards are trained on a two-cane VSP (vertical shoot positioning) trellis and crop thinning are carried out to target a modest yield of 7.5 T/Ha.<br><strong>Winemaking</strong><br>The three clones were hand-picked separately at high ripeness levels and whole-bunch pressed using very low maceration press cycles. The resulting juice was cold settled, then racked to fermentation vessels. Most of the juice went through a natural indigenous yeast fermentation in old French oak barriques and the balance was fermented in stainless steel tanks using cultured yeast. Towards the end of fermentation, all the wine was transferred to stainless steel tanks, where the fermentations were stopped, retaining 11 g/l residual sugar. The blended wine was then filled into old barrels, remaining on yeast lees for a further five months, prior to bottling in November 2018 with alcohol 14.4%, pH 3.50 and acidity of 5.5 g/l.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0684/6336/2367/products/greywacke-pinot-gris.jpg?v=1690806112,BBW-WINE-439,58.0000000000

Different ratios of gravel, sand and clay within the Sierozem soil account for variations across wineries in the area. Eolian soil is made of wind deposited materials that consist primarily of sand or silt-sized particles. Silver Heights’ vineyards are all on Sierozem soil, with a high concentration of gravel.<br>One unique viticultural feature of the region is the practice of burying the vines under 30 cm (12 inches) of earth to protect them during the harsh, freezing winters.<br>Psst, Marselan is a recent crossing between two famous red grape varieties, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon. Wines made from Marselan are medium-bodied with fine tannins, good color, and characteristics of cherry and cassis.<br>

Notes of black and red fruit, licorice, cardamom, and a floral bouquet come forth in this incredibly drinkable Zinfandel. Its palate is lively with bright acidity in a concentrated body with a beautiful balance and tannic structure. The wine exudes notes of cloves and cherries.<br>The fruit is destemmed into 5 ton stainless steel open-top fermenters, where it ferments naturally. It is then aged in 60 gallon neutral French oak barrels for 10 months.<br>Zinfandel first came to California during the Gold Rush. It grows beautifully and thrives in California soil. The winemaking team loved Zinfandel's older expressions before it got a bad name in California for being high in alcohol and overly ripe. Wirth Vineyard’s Zinfandel is different from the Vine Starr Zinfandel. It is slightly more concentrated with more tannins and beautiful acidity. The fruit is very special and we are excited to share this bottle with you.<br>Wirth Vineyard’s Zinfandel was planted in 1948 on the vineyard’s hillside and thrives in the volcanic iron-rich soils. The old vines are dry-farmed with low yields (1 ton per acre). Steve Wirth took over farming from his dad a few decades ago.

Terredora's vineyards consist of volcanic soils rich in limestone and clay, and enjoy the southern exposure with an excellent microclimate, on windy hills (400-650 meters above sea level).<br>The grapes are harvested by hand and placed in small baskets with a minimal time span between the removal of the grapes from the stem to the press.

The harvest takes place in the third period and selected grapes are pressed with special equipment. The must is then sent to steel tanks where it is fermented for about 15 days at 27°C. During fermentation, the high temperature and long period allow the extraction of tannic elements and adequate acidity to form, making the bottle suitable for ageing.<br>The wine then undergoes a period of ageing for about 3 years, of which 2 years were spent in oak or chestnut barrels.

Average temperature is 14.4°C with extreme diurnal temperature variations. Growing season is around 270 days, 3000-3200 sunshine hours per year. The dramatic swing in temperature variation means that our grapes’ exposure to sunlight increases the ripening qualities while the sudden drop in temperature at night preserves the balance of natural acids in the grapes, resulting in more resilient and intense flavoured grapes with high acid and high sugar contents.<br>Vineyards lie on a bed of permeable soil that is rich in minerals, giving their wines a particularly smooth texture with flavours with depth and complexity.

They are destemmed before fermentation is conducted in stainless steel tanks at a controlled temperature of 28°C with selected yeasts. Once the fermentation is completed, part of the wine matures in American oak barrels for a period of eight months before being lightly filtered during bottling.<br>

<br>60% Chardonnay and 40% Ribolla. Hand-picked grapes from a vineyard with vines an average age of 32 years, limestone and marl soils, and single guyot vine training. Primary fermentation occurs in large tanks on natural yeasts from the same pre-harvested grapes (5%). Maceration lasts for 1 day, giving the wine its sensitive rosé hue. Next is gentle pressing at low pressure levels. Secondary fermentation occurs on lees in oak barriques with no racking. Ageing for four years in barriques, letting it become naturally stable and ready for a long life. No fining, no filtration, no added sulphites.</div>

<h4>How to disgorge Puro:</h4>
<br>Puro is special because you have to disgorge it yourself when you open the bottle! Disgorgement, or <em class=""article-body__emphasis mc-text--italic"">dégorgement</em> in French, is a technique used in the traditional method of sparkling wine production that removes dead yeast cells and sediment from the neck of the wine bottle after secondary fermentation. Wine producers typically disgorge the wine for you by freezing the bottle’s neck and quickly extracting the solids. You'll have to disgorge Puro by hand the old-fashioned way – by opening the bottle and quickly releasing the sentiment.<br>The reason Puro isn't disgorged by its producers is to give the wine a continuous, endless life with its own natural yeasts. It also means the wine contains no preservatives. Some may find this procedure of opening the wine unpractical. But we think that besides drinking it, opening Puro is a fun experience!<br>Watch the short video below for a quick demonstration on how to disgorge Puro without breaking anything or losing all your wine.<br>

I suppose if I'm being really nitpicky this lacks just a touch of freshness and verve even though it's clear that the idea here is to deliver a wine with real depth. I would be the first to acknowledge that it is very difficult to deliver depth with freshness because of the very nature of developing the complexity in the first place.

Their perennial favourite, which still echoes in David’s mind’s palate, was the “HP” Shiraz blends from the first half of the 70’s. They never fail to remind just how great Barossa Shiraz really is.<br>David’s tribute to his father is to resurrect the ‘Hydraulic Press Shiraz’, reinforcing this link with his past and bringing beautiful rich and soft Barossa Shiraz to a new generation of wine drinkers. This is a fantastic reflection of the traditional ‘Barossa style’.<br> <br>Here are other interesting <a href=""https://boundbywine.com/marketplace/?filter_wine_country=australia&amp;query_type_wine_country=or&amp;filter_wine_region=barossa-valley-australia&amp;query_type_wine_region=or"">wines from Barossa Valley</a>!<br>

<h4>A short background story:</h4>
Inspired by Phil’s (David's brother) love and mastery of this noble variety. Back in 2008, 8 years before pulling together the 2016 Brother’s Ilk, Phil said to David: ""let’s make a Chardonnay."" To which David responded with “are you fucking joking?” The answer was no and the result was the first iteration of the Brother’s Ilk Chardonnay. Adelaide Hills Stalwarts, Theo and Jan Moskos’ Bernard 95 clone fruit, grown on their Birdwood block have underpinned these offerings ever since. The 2016 Brother‘s Ilk is tribute to Phil’s thinking, Theo and Jan Moskos’ Bernard 95 clone fruit and the David Franz team's hard graft in the winery. It’s a bit of old school smashed together with a lot of new thinking all wrapped up in a bloody tasty wine.<br> <br>Here are other interesting <a href=""https://boundbywine.com/marketplace/?filter_wine_country=australia&amp;query_type_wine_country=or&amp;filter_wine_region=barossa-valley-australia&amp;query_type_wine_region=or"">wines from Barossa Valley</a>!</div>

Favourable soils of pebbles, sand and clay bestow great freshness to the wine. The climate is dry with significant temperature fluctuations between day and night.

Cold pre-fermentation maceration. Pumping over one and a half times the volume at the beginning of fermentation, half the volume at the end of fermentation.

<div class=""column"">
<br>Deep garnet red colour with a pink rim. An array of raspy red berries, cherries and plums open the intense and complex bouquet, following with nuances of coconut, vanilla, leather, tobacco, coffee and earthy porcini mushroom. The fresh palate possesses a vibrant energy and elegance thanks to well-integrated sweet tannins and a lively acidity. Flavours on the palate linger between a union of fruity and earthy – raspberries, wild strawberries, red currants, cherries and plums mingling amongst forest floor, mushroom, cedar and a balsamic touch. Simply delicious long finish.</div>

<br>The Arana name became a trademark in 1974, named after one of the families at the helm of La Rioja Alta. It is only made in high quality vintages and completes a sibling trio of Gran Reservas from Rioja Alta, the others being the iconic 904 and 890 Gran Reservas. The blend of Arana has evolved from its original ""recipe"", with Graciano replacing Mazuelo.<br>Arana was the only Gran Reserva in 2014, so all of the fruit normally used to make 904 and 890 was used in the Arana Gran Reserva.

<br>94% Tempranillo and 6% Graciano. Tempranillo came from Las Cuevas, El Palo and Las Monjas vineyards in Rodezno, whilst the Graciano came from the Montecillo estate in Fuenmayor.<br>The Tempranillo harvest was first, with the Graciano in Montecillo following 20 days later. The grapes were placed in small boxes and taken to the winery in refrigerated transport to preserve their integrity. Vinification occurs separately. Alcoholic fermentation took place in stainless steel tanks, lasting 19 days. After malolactic fermentation, in April 2015, a selected number of wines were transferred to American oak barrels (made in-house) with an average age of 4.5 years. Ageing in barrels for 3 years, with a traditional racking every 6 months. Final blend in April 2018, then bottling in June 2018.</div>

La Consulta was Nicolás Catena’s father, Domingo’s preferred Malbec location. The Vineyard, at 1,095m has very shallow loamy topsoil with surface gravel and large stones and dry riverbed subsoil, which is optimal for drainage<br>100% whole cluster and 90% while berry fruit is hand-loaded into 225-500 liter new French oak barrels for a 100% barrel fermentation for a period of 15 days, allowing sealmess oak integration. The fermentation temperature is kept low, extracring intense aromas and the cap management is done by hand to ensure soft, gentle flavours and tannin extraction. Alcoholic and malolactic fermentation in the barrel, leaves considerable lees and sediment. The wine is aged in French oak barrels for 18 months, followed by 24 months of aging in bottle before release.<br>Interested in <a href=""https://boundbywine.com/product/alamos-malbec-2018/"">Argentine wines</a>?<br>

<a href=""https://www.eikendal.com"">Eikendal Vineyards</a> Cabernet Sauvignon is sophisticated and full-bodied. If you like a slight sweetness from young cab sauvs then this is definitely for you to drink now. On the nose is an earthiness with a hint of seaweed, and fresh notes of ripe cassis. Its strong character displays aspects of ripe berries, dark chocolate, spices, mineral, rock pool and iodine. Silky tannins await on the palate, complemented by a fruitiness and delicate oak flavours with a lingering aftertaste.<br>

<br>100% Cabernet Sauvignon from the Eikendal Wine Estate vineyard in Stellenbosch. The Stellenbosch vineyards were planted in 2003 in “Koffieklip” (“Coffee Stone”) soil with a clay layer 1m deep on the lower, western slopes of the Helderberg.<br>

<br>After hand-picking, the grapes are cooled to 1°C. They then go through destemming in the cellar but no crushing. 10–15 days of cold soaking follows, before spontaneous fermentation with 1–2 punch downs per day. A long, slow fermentation at around 34°C, then a soft pressing. The wine settles for 1–2 weeks before going to barrel. The wine then ages for 12 months in 300 litre 30% new Burgundian Pierre du Bourgogne oak barrels. Finally is six months of refinement in bottle.<br>

Take a sip, pause and taste the sea; refreshing and alive. The dry palate is rich with flavor and texture, with a hint of tangy acidity.<br><br>This wine was created to combine both strawberries and cream in a glass. The winemakers at L.A.S found that if pinot noir was picked early, aromas of strawberries would shine! Chardonnay can give traits of butter and cream with malolactic fermentation and stirring of the lees. The first year the wine was made, the Pinot Noir and Chardonnay were whole bunch pressed in the exact same way, resulting in a wine that is not as rosy as expected but white. Thus, the Albino PNO was born (80% Pinot Noir, 20% Chardonnay).<br>The Pinot Noir and Chardonnay vineyard is situated 3km from the Indian ocean on a gentle north-facing slope, that flows into a dam. It’s one of the last vineyards in Margaret River that contain Pinot Noir.

Some Pinot Noir is also sourced from a small parcel in the Bottelary Hills on decomposed granite soil.<br>The winemaking process is as minimal as possible. All the ferments take place using wild yeasts and no additives (barring some sulphur dioxide at crush and during maturation) is being used. 40 – 60% of whole clusters are used in the fermentation to bring a natural structure and savouriness to the wines. Extraction is kept very gentle using a combination of pump-overs and punchdowns, and the wines spend about 30 days on skins to allow a gentle evolution of their structure.<br>The wines are matured for 9 months in a mix of older small French oak barrels to avoid a dominant oak character and round out their structure before blending and bottling.<br>

<div class=""column"">
<br><br>The wine is composed of a number of carefully selected vineyard sites in the Western Cape. The aromas are yellow plum, kumquat, lemon thyme, soft brioche and crushed oyster shell. In the mouth, the wine starts broad and rich, resolving into a keen line of acidity supported by a gentle tannin.<br><img class=""alignnone size-medium wp-image-12277 aligncenter"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/line-e1590996348338-300x30.png?v=1642666597"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""30""><br>The vineyard selection supports Thorne and Daughters’vision to deliver a blended Cape White wine of depth, texture and subtlety. In sourcing Roussanne, Chardonnay, Semillon, Clairette Blanche and Chenin Blanc, they are looking for both heritage and young vineyards which all bring their own unique elements and ability to “speak” about the place in which they are grown.<br>Rocking Horse is the cornerstone wine and takes its name from a wooden rocking horse that was made for the winemakers’ daughters out of old oak barrel staves. This signature wine is where all the work comes together to make the most complete wine.<br>2019 was warm and dry, with little disease pressure. The primary challenge during the harvest is to ensure that all of the far-flung blocks are picked at the right time and are brought back to the winery in perfect condition. Once this is achieved, the winemakers revert to working with very little in the way of the winemaking technique.<br>Picking is done early and based mostly on taste, with an eye on the style of the wine that they’re aiming at. They are not looking for big alcohol expression and prefer subtle wines that show ripeness while being restrained and elegant.<br>The grapes are whole-bunch pressed and no treatments or additions are used on the juice. This hands-off regime on the juice really helps to develop the character of the wine. The juice is then racked off the heavy solids and taken to old oak barrels of various volumes. The wines are fermented naturally and they are allowed to go through their subsequent malolactic fermentation. They are then monitored carefully for the next few months until they “settle down”, at which, sulphur dioxide is added.<br>

Sarmassa is located on a south-eastern facing slope. The mainly clay and limestone soils have a very substantial percentage of stones. The significant quantity of stones, combined with clay, limits the growth of the Nebbiolo grape. It prepares the vines to react quickly to climatic variations, enabling clusters to ripen perfectly.<br>After hand-harvesting, the grapes go through destemming and soft pressing. Fermentation takes place at a controlled temperature in thermo-regulated tanks. Maceration lasts for 10 days. Next, the wine is racked in cement tanks, which are lined with fibreglass and isolated by cork to maintain the post-fermentation temperature of 22°C. In this way, malolactic fermentation begins spontaneously and only ends after two months. The wine then ages for 2 years: a part in 30 hectolitre Slavonian oak barrels and the other part in small 225 litre French medium-toasted oak barrels. The two parts are blended in traditional big oak barrels. Finally, the wine completes its fining in bottle.<br>Interested in what else we've got from Marchesi di Barolo?

<strong>Fun fact:</strong> Artemis is named after the Greek Goddess of the Hunt. The Stag's Leap signature style has often been described as “an iron fist in a velvet glove”. A reference to the artful balance between ripeness and restraint, softness and structure, that yields Napa Valley wines of exceptional beauty and long life. Sourced from the estate's prime vineyards. The wine was aged for 16 months in 43% new oak barriques (38% French and 5% American), thereafter balanced in older French and American oak. Interested in other Napa Valley wines?

Notes of white peach, soft lemon zest, ripe pear and plenty of minerality. A very smooth feel and a bit of weight on the palate. Mineral rather than fruit-driven, with a round character and crisp acidity that offers precision and finesse. Wraps up in a long, refreshing lemon and steel finish.<br><br>100% Chardonnay sourced from 40-year-old vines in a 3.2 hectare plot just beneath the famous 1er Cru Montée de Tonnerre. The soils here are a bit deeper as it used to be a riverbed. The quality of this spot as a ‘village wine’ is outstanding. The plot has a southeast exposition and deep soils of clay and limestone composition. The grapes are harvested by hand and then wild fermented in steel tanks. The wine then matures in 6–30 year old barriques for 12 months.<br><strong>Top tip:</strong> Delicious to drink now, but has the quality to mature for up to 5 years from bottling.<br>The Chablis region is the northernmost wine district of Burgundy, France. The region's cool climate produces wines with more acidity and flavours less fruity than Chardonnay wines grown in warmer climates. Subtly different in style than the rest of Burgundy wines, a touch more austere with a beautiful fresh minerality.<br>Interested in trying more Chablis?

From low-caste to South Africa’s most noble grape, there isn't a grape whose reputation in the wine world has made a turnaround quite as romantic and astonishing as the Chenin Blanc's.<br>A very tasty white created by a fresh generation of Chenin producers. Medium gold colour. This wine is all about subtlety and finesse. The bouquet offers ripe apricot, honey and cooked apple aromas, with a hint of oak and stoney minerals. Full-bodied and dry on the palate, with a citrus fruit spectrum, ripe stone fruit and a wonderful refreshing saltiness. Closes with a long and persistent mineral finish.<br>The fruit for this wine comes from a single block of old Chenin bush vines on the foot of Helderberg Mountain, facing southeast across False Bay. The vines grow high on a steep slope in slightly decomposed granite soils with patches of pure quartz near the top. These gnarly old vines produce a low yield of small berries with a wonderful concentration. After whole bunch pressing the grapes, the free-run juice settles for 2 days before it is poured into barrel. Alcohol fermentation lasts for 8–10 weeks under cool conditions in old oak barrels (using only natural ambient yeast). The wine is kept on lees throughout its 9 month maturation before it is racked out of barrel, assembled and left to settle for a month.<br>Hear more about the story behind Chenin Blanc's rebirth from Alex Dale himself <a href=""https://www.radforddale.com/chenin-blanc"">here</a>.<br> <br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12411"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/alcohol-1-300x300.png?v=1642666758"" alt="""" width=""65"" height=""65"">12.5%<br><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>AWARDS &amp; ACCOLADES</strong></span><br><img class=""alignnone  wp-image-16776"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/tim-atkin-300x170.jpg?v=1642753404"" alt="""" width=""238"" height=""135""><strong> - 96 POINTS,  ONE OF THE WINES OF THE YEAR</strong><br><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-12857"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/22.png?v=1642667103"" alt="""" width=""60"" height=""54""> The Renaissance hails from a single vineyard on the Helderberg that also supplies the core of the Vinum Chenin.

100% Pinot Noir sourced from the Talinay vineyard in Limarí Valley. The Limarí Valley lies in one of the most Northern winegrowing regions in Chile. 12km from the Pacific Ocean, where there is a constant cool sea breeze. The Camanchaca fog rejuvenates the vineyards with cool and moist air on summer mornings, while the afternoon sun provides a warm and dry condition. This cooling effect is similar to that of the Napa Valley in California. The annual rainfall here is about 101mm and the vineyards in Limarí Valley relies mainly on drip irrigation drawn from the Limarí River, which source is from the Andes.<br>The vineyards are planted in calcareous soils where the rock is limestone. This is a place with a geological phenomenon that is unique in Chile and that gives a very particular characteristic to the wines.<br>

<div class=""column"">A killer full-bodied white blend. Rich golden colour. The bouquet opens to fill a room with the heady scent of ripe peach, beeswax and pineapple. The aromas follow through to the crisp palate, where peach nectar and tropical fruit flavours are bolstered by complex savoury notes of buttered brioche and Ontario limestone. Complex and intense, with a broad and long finish.<br>Stratus Vineyard sits on 62 acres near the southeastern border of the Niagara Lakeshore sub-appellation. The vineyard is far enough away from the moderating influence of Lake Ontario to grow grape varieties that need warmer temperatures in the summer. At the same time, the lake’s proximity helps to protect the vines from early frost in the fall.<br>The vineyard soil is composed of mineral-rich layers resting on a limestone foundation. Stratus Vineyards is one of the few wineries in the world that don’t use a pump. Moving wine with pumping can introduce air and compromise flavours. Instead of pumping, they use a gravity flow system. Wine flows naturally by gravity from stainless steel or oak fermenters into carefully selected French oak barrels, where it will age under the care of the cellar master.<br>The Stratus White 2016 is an assemblage of five estate grown varietals: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Viognier, Semillon and Gewürztraminer. The grapes are manually harvested and sorted on table by hand. The grapes then go through extended ripening, skin contact during fermentation, and 627 days of barrel ageing on lees in French oak (11% new). The blending process adds so much to this wine, allowing winemaker J-L Groux to craft something unique with each vintage.<br>Drinking window: 2020–2031</div>

This is a situation that had no occurred for many years, but it helped natural eliminate vine pests and also feeding the water reserves of the subsoil. The first week of March saw a rise in temperature but was immediately followed by further cold waves. The germination of the vines was delayed. In Spring, the vegetation was excellent, followed by sporadic rainfall alternating with sunny days, creating a favourable condition, allowing the completion of the phases of flowering and fruit set under the best conditions. The temperature in summer went up, delaying the ripening of the grapes. The production was slightly lower than average but of excellent quality, the grapes were well-ripened and aromatic with low sugar. The result was a balanced must, adequately sapid with perfect harmony between the structure and the acidity of the wine.<br>The grapes were carefully selected by hand by the bunches. The grapes were destemmed and soft pressed. Primary fermentation was done in stainless steel vats at a controlled temperature of 29 – 30°C without the addition of external yeasts. Maceration on the skins for 12 – 15 days for the Cabernet Sauvignon and about 15 – 18 days for the Sangiovese, with subsequent phases of pumping over and deléstage to soften and refine the tannins. Malolactic fermentation was carried out in steel and concluded in mid-November. At the end of malolactic fermentation, the wine was aged for about 8 months in French oak barriques of third passage previously used for Sassicaia.<br>Give other wines from <a href=""https://www.boundbywine.com/product/tenuta-san-guido-guidalberto-toscana-igt-2016/"">Tenuta</a> a try!<br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12411"" style=""font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/alcohol-1-300x300.png?v=1642666758"" alt="""" width=""61"" height=""61""><span style=""font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"">14%</span><br>

<br>100% Cabernet Sauvignon sourced from Dom Vineyard in Maipo Valley. The vineyard is located in the Metropolitan Region, in a transversal mountain chain belonging to the Coastal Range. It is planted 320 metres above sea level on south facing slopes, with a cool climate and few hours of sunshine. As a result, the grapes ripen more slowly, producing fresher and more elegant wines. The colluvial soil is broken up by very stony layers that have been formed because fractured rocks from the cliffs fell to the base and rest there, forming a soil with very angular stones. This soil is perfect for planting Cabernet Sauvignon because of its low fertility, which naturally controls the growth and production of grapes, resulting in very high quality.<br><div class=""page"" title=""Page 1"">

<br>The grapes were hand-harvested into 20kg-bins when this variety reached optimum phenolic ripeness. The clusters were carefully selected, then destemmed and selected one last time. Fermentation took place in small stainless steel tanks at controlled temperatures. Maceration occurred after the alcoholic fermentation. Finally, the wine aged in French oak barrels for ten months.<br>

The complex nose is elegant and very spicy with black fruit, dark chocolate and a touch of tobacco leaf. Juicy and firm on the palate with smooth tannins, an agile acidity and a perfect combination between oak, blackcurrant and black cherry fruit flavours. Elegant and long finish.<br>

<br>100% Carmenère sourced from old vines in Cachapoal Valley. Though Tabalí's home turf is Limarí Valley, on the edge of the Atacama desert, this comes from furter south in the coastal Cachapoal region. The Cachapoal Vineyard is one of the best areas in Chile for producing Carmenère. The vines were planted in 1950 and now produce low yields, which are reflected in high-quality wines. The vineyard is located 300 metres above sea level on north facing slopes, with a Mediterranean climate and many hours of sunshine. It is planted on a slope of decomposed granite, which allows the roots to penetrate deeply through the whole soil profile.<br><div class=""page"" title=""Page 1"">

<br>100% Sauvignon Blanc sourced from the Talinay vineyard. Talinay vineyard is located in the Limarí Valley on the indomitable cool coast of northern Chile. The vineyard is situated 12km from the Pacific Ocean and has a constant cool sea breeze. It experiences much lower temperatures than the rest of the valley, making it the vineyard with the coolest climate in the whole of Limarí Valley. The vines are actually planted on an ancient marine terrace that has surfaced. The area has a very porous, fractured limestone soil, which allows roots to easily explore the rock.<br><div class=""page"" title=""Page 1"">

<br>Every single task in the vineyard, from pruning to harvesting, is carefully supervised by their viticultural and winemaking team in order to produce the best quality fruit possible. The grapes were hand-harvested into 20kg-bins when this variety reached optimum aromatic and phenolic ripeness. The clusters were later carefully selected, then destemmed and selected one last time. Fermentation took place in small stainless steel tanks at low temperatures (11°C–13°C) in order to retain all the freshness and fruit flavours and aromas in the wine. The wine was finally aged in stainless steel tanks.<br>

The grapes were harvested manually and placed in 20kg tubs, then taken to the winery using refrigerated transportation. At the winery, the fruit was carefully sorted and the best clusters destemmed. The grapes were then cooled to 10°C and macerated for 10 hours. After this, the must was separated in membrane presses, under inert atmosphere to prevent oxidation. After decanting, the clean must was fermented at 15°C. For this vintage, malolactic fermentation took place in 10% of the tanks. The wine was kept on the lees until bottling, with periodic punch downs to keep them in suspension and provide the wine with complexity.</div>

<br>After years of studying the vineyard and intensive oenological work, Torre de Oña presents its most innovative and expressive estate wine. The Torre de Oña estate is a part of Grupo La <a href=""https://www.riojawine.com/en/home-en/"">Rioja</a> Alta, S.A., one of the most impressive and resolutely traditional of the regions’s bodegas.<br>Idyllic surroundings. A silent sea of vineyards. An allegorical setting. The Torre de Oña winery is located in one of the most exclusive and privileged regions of the Rioja Alavesa subzone, part of the Rioja D.O.Ca., where the best wineries and vineyards of this recognised winemaking area are located. The vineyards are watched over by the Cantabria Ridge, which acts as a protective barrier for wind and cold from the north. At 630 metres above sea level, it is situated close to the altitude limit for grapevine growing in this area.<br>The ‘Martelo vineyard’ is very special and difficult to manage, as the quality of the cultivated grapes depends largely on weather conditions throughout the growth cycle. This is why Martelo is only produced in very good or excellent years. Produced with grapes from their oldest vines, the wine comprises a grape variety blend of 95% Tempranillo and 5% Mazuelo, Garnacha and Viura. Starting in 2005, the terroir of each plot was studied carefully and vinified separately. Martelo Reserva is a single vineyard red – what they call a field blend. The grapes were put through a cold soak after alcoholic fermentation then in barrique for a slow malolactic fermentation of 96 days. This was followed by an élevage in 80% American and 20% French oak barrels for two years, during which time it was racked four times.</div>

After a manual harvest and careful selection, the destemmed grapes go through traditional maceration and malolactic fermentation. The wine is then aged in wooden barrels for at least one year.<br>

The singularity of this 1.75 hectare plot of vineyards is that the bedrock is almost on the surface, with 18% active chalk in it. In other words, it’s a very poor soil where the vines struggle to survive and produce small bunches of concentrated grapes, especially the vines that are planted directly on the rock. That’s why they select it grape by grape. The grapes are fermented in stainless steel with pumping-over and the wine transferred to new French oak barrels where malolactic fermentation is carried out and the wine ages for 18 months. It has a very fresh nose of small berries with a lactic, spicy note starting to develop complexity. The medium-bodied palate has fine tannins, very good acidity with plenty of stuffing in a serious wine with great balance and length. With time and air it develops a subtle balsamic note of aromatic herbs. It’s a great elegant, subtle Rioja.

<br>The winery is located in the almost crater-like Elgin Valley, surrounded by a craggy fringe of mountains. The vineyard is never below 200m above sea level and its environment's architecture funnels a cool breeze from the Atlantic a few kilometres away. The vines grow in steep west facing slopes with sandstone, shale and light clay soils. Due to the climate and steep inclines in the valley, there is a good flow of rainwater through the soils and shales, which are characterised by fossils and mineral deposits. The vines are planted close together within each row to encourage low yields, and Koen's philosophy is that: “Competition with their neighbours helps the vines to stay healthy and results in wines that have a deep colour and matching complexity.”</div>

This wine has helped define the new style of Pinotage in South Africa whereby winemakers have taken their cues from the great wines of Burgundy, rather than Bordeaux. The logic being that Pinotage is descended from Pinot Noir, so it should be made in that way. This results in grapes that are generally picked earlier, with higher natural acidity and perhaps a slightly lower potential alcohol. The wine is not heavily extracted in the winery (working the skins via punch-downs and pump-overs), this leaves room in the wine for the lighter, more perfumed, elegant side of Pinotage to come to the fore.

<br>One of the most highly regarded Australian winemakers, William ""Bill"" Downie established his own label in 2003 after several years of living and working in Burgundy. He is fanatical about the quality of his fruit and where it comes from, so sources fruit from vineyards that use biodynamic and organic viticultural practices when possible. Although each of the William Downie wines is made from Pinot Noir, the Yarra Valley, Mornington Peninsula and Gippsland are more different than they are similar.<br>Medium ruby colour. Lifted and delightfully aromatic with ripe red cherries, raspberries, redcurrant, pretty floral violets and a hint of smoke and earthy forest floor wafting from the glass. The concentrated palate offers silky flavours of red fruit, earth and spice. A textured mouthfeel with chewy tannins and a crisp acidity, which closes in a persistent smoke and fruit finish.<br>The fruit is carefully selected and hand harvested from vineyards situated in Lucinda Estate and Berry's Creek near Leongatha in South Gippsland. Organic principles are implemented wherever possible in the vineyards. The vineyard soils here are red volcanic clay loam and are situated 120 metres above sea level. The vines were planted in 1990 and 1998 respectively, both with a density of 6,500 vines per hectare. The fruit is hand sorted and destemmed before fermentation took place in wooden open-top fermenters. The wine receives minimal intervention, with no temperature regulation, punch downs or additions made. The wine was pressed after 30 days of maceration and then filled to 30% new french oak for 10 months. Finally, the wine was bottled without fining or filtration.<br>

<br>From a young Australian winemaker who may seem to have burst onto the wine scene overnight. This is far from the truth however, as Patrick has studied, travelled and worked hard in unrecognised roles for years before entering the well-deserved limelight. Patrick Sullivan works with his wife Megan in Yarra Valley to produce authentic wines that reflect the terroir. They produce different wines that sell out almost immediately.<br>Amazon is a beautifully soft, textural and succulent Pinot Noir. Ruby ​​red colour. On the aromatic nose, fresh raspberries, wild berries, dark plums and red cherries are followed by notes of alpine herbs, forest floor and pepper. The palate is light, fresh and well-balanced with ripe red summer fruit flavours. Medium-bodied and dry, with fine tannins and a crunchy acidity. Closes with a persistent and charismatic finish. We love it!<br>The grapes are sourced from organic and biodynamic vineyards. In the cellar, the wines receive minimal intervention. Fermentation and refining take place in steel tanks or ceramic eggs, but ageing occurred in wooden barrels for this Pinot Noir.<br>

The Yangarra GSM is a class act. This single vineyard wine from the stunning Yangarra estate in Kangarilla sets a high bar for all others in the region. Winemaker Peter Fraser has focused his attentions on producing the country's finest iterations of Rhone varieties and this is arguably his best version of this classic blend to date.<br>The dizzying aromatics and succulent fruit of Grenache meets the plum/choc combo of McLaren Vale Shiraz and the grunt of Mourvedre. This is the quintessential McLaren Vale red.<br>This GSM is a careful blending of Grenache, Shiraz and Mourvèdre in which the composition varies from year to year, conveying the traditional estate blends of the southern Rhône. The backbone of this wine comes from our old bush vine Grenache planted in 1946.<br>Blend: 58% Grenache, 24% Shiraz, and 18% Mourvedre.<br>A bright and fragrant aroma, with spicy red and blue fruits. The blending of these three varieties is an equal mix of sharp precision as much as sensuality. Its fruit is bright, shiny and fresh, showing that silky sheen of the Grenache, yet below are more brooding layers which will unfold over the next decade. Without upsetting this harmonious balance, the Shiraz and Mourvèdre will gradually emerge.<br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12411"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/alcohol-1-300x300.png?v=1642666758"" alt="""" width=""59"" height=""59"">14.5%<br><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">AWARDS &amp; ACCOLADES</span></strong><br><strong><img class=""alignnone wp-image-14823"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/JS_92-300x300.jpg?v=1642750893"" alt="""" width=""186"" height=""186""></strong><br><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-12857"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/22.png?v=1642667103"" alt="""" width=""60"" height=""54""><br>A spicy GSM blend with lots of ripe black cherries, a hint of ivy extract, dark licorice and some cassis.

These wines are renowned for their remarkable richness, concentration and firm tannic structure: a combination that yields impressive longevity. Vintage Ports are only made in years of exceptionally high quality harvests, which on average occur two or three times in a decade. The weather in the vineyards is the principal determining factor: conditions must be ideal throughout the growing season, as well as during the subsequent harvest.<br>This wine is produced from vines at Graham's flagship vineyard Quinta dos Malvedos, with small parcels of top graded grapes from the other vineyards that supply Graham’s Quinta do Tua, Quinta da Vila Velha, Quinta das Lages and Quinta do Vale das Malhadas. In 2017, 42% less rain fell at Malvedos than the 30 year average and the vines produced a small but extremely high-quality crop with extraordinary concentration. The wine was fermented in small batches at Graham's specialist on-site winery at Malvedos. It carries the classic Graham’s hallmarks – full-bodied, rich, and opulent – and will provide great drinking pleasure for decades to come.</div>

<div class=""column"">The 10 Year Old Tawny is a very fine Graham’s Aged Tawny – it left our palates feeling all tingly!<br>The grapes are handpicked. Fermentation takes place with natural yeast between 26–30ºC. Once the must reaches the desired degree of sweetness (usually within 48 hours), fortification takes place with the addition of grape spirit at 77% alcohol by volume. Matured for 10 years in seasoned oak casks, this is Graham’s Master Blender’s personal interpretation of a fine, old, wood-matured Port.<br>Graham's 10 Year Old Tawny is for those who seek a rewarding experience from a well-aged Tawny Port. The younger style of aged Tawny Port preserves some of the grapes’ ripe fruit flavours and tannins, which are complemented by the added complexity achieved by a decade of ageing in oak.<br>Deep golden-amber colour. Complex nose with generous nutty aromas and hints of orange peel, cinnamon, raisins, honey and figs. Rich fruit and caramelised nut flavours emerge on the palate, beautifully mellowed with a lusciously long finish.<br>

<div class=""column"">Six Grapes Special ‘River Quintas’ Edition pays homage to the original Six Grapes label, Graham's signature Reserve blend.<br>Deep bluish-purple colour, as opaque as a young Vintage Port. Aromas of blackberry and cassis with hints of mint and eucalyptus, ending on a note of tar and spice. The concentrated palate features dark plum and ripe cherry, liquorice and chocolate flavours. Balanced by a wonderful fresh acidity and a persistent, taut finish.<br>Delightful at the end of a meal. Especially if served with rich, nutty or chocolate desserts, or a variety of cheeses. Or you can enjoy it on its own: it is a dessert in itself!<br>Two classic riverside vineyard sites were chosen for this special blend: Quinta do Tua and Quinta dos Malvedos. The over 50-year-old mixed varietal plantings from Quinta do Tua, typically picked early in the harvest, consistently produce outstanding results, with minimal average yields of 0.65 kg of grapes per vine. Graham’s flagship Quinta dos Malvedos produces extraordinarily concentrated Touriga Franca grapes picked towards the end of the harvest. These 32-year-old vines benefit from a very favourable south/south-west aspect, where the plentiful exposure to the Douro sun is well-suited for late-ripening Touriga Franca.
<div class=""page"" title=""Page 1"">
<div class=""section"">
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">
<br>The blend of Six Grapes Special ‘River Quintas’ Edition is made up of approximately one third each of Quinta do Tua’s 2014 and 2015 vintages, and one third from the Malvedos Touriga Franca ‘Vinha dos Barcos’ vineyard made in 2015. The wines were all vinified in the lagares at the Malvedos winery. The three components are married together to produce a charming and complex wine.<br>

It is a blend of just two vintages (2014 and 2015) from three specific parcels closer to the river. This is lovely, only moderately concentrated, but fresh and lively, with fine flavors lingering on the finish. I'd like to see a version of this from two bigger vintages, but it shows well and is fresh, easy and ready on release. It comes with a bar-top cork. It can hold a while, but it isn't meant to be held, and it doesn't need much air or aging. There were 500 cases produced.</div>

<br>The name Six Grapes refers to the symbol Graham’s uses to classify wines on a scale of one to six, with Six Grapes denoting the lots with Vintage Port potential. By the early 1900’s, Graham’s started bottling and offering a wine carefully selected from these ‘lotes’ under the Six Grapes label.  Over a century later, Six Grapes continues to be Graham’s signature wine and a quality benchmark for the Port category.<br>From Graham’s five key vineyard properties (Malvedos, Tua, Lages, Vila Velha and Vale de Malhadas), the lots with the most concentration, structure and the brightest fruit are given the coveted Six Grapes classification. Comprises four primary varietals of Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Tinta Barroca, with additional components of Tinta Amarela,Tinta Cão, Souzão and Tinta Francisca as well as grapes from some older mixed plantings.<br>At all five Graham’s Quintas, each varietal is picked according to its ideal ripeness, and the fermentations of each varietal and vineyard block kept separate. Following the harvest in Spring, the wines travel from the Quinta dos Malvedos winery to Graham’s 1890 Lodge in Vila Nova de Gaia, where they will typically spend a few years in seasoned oak vats before being incorporated into the Six Grapes blend. The blending team carefully matches the new blend to the previous one to maintain Six Grape's outstanding level of quality. Once in bottle, the wine is ready to drink and does not require further ageing.<br>

Rather than the savoury woody notes normally found in white Port, Graham's Blend No. 5 is all about floral, honey and citrus flavours. In fact, it is so intense that its taste can be described as a botanically-flavoured wine.<br>The grapes are hand-picked and cold fermented in small batches. Once the required sugar level is reached, neutral wine spirit (77% vol) is added. This raises the alcohol content up to 19% and stops fermentation. Graham’s Blend No. 5 is bottled 3 months after the harvest to preserve maximum freshness and should be drunk young.<br>The wine is medium-dry, deliberately designed to mix well with tonic. Also an excellent standalone drink. Micro produced with less than 6,000 bottles.<br>

Hence the name Zingari, meaning Gypsies. The vineyards are located on clay and sandy soils at the foot of the hills, and produce a magnificent crop of varieties: Syrah, Merlot, Sangiovese and Petit Verdot.

The palate balances ripe fruits with butter, vanilla, honeyed brioche and complex minerality. Full-bodied, rich and creamy texture of the palate extends through to a long finish.<br>The Toscana Chardonnay <em>Private Collection</em> of Isole e Olena is born from vineyards located in the Florentine municipality of Barberino Val d'Elsa. Paolo De Marchi grafted Chardonnay onto existing vines on the Isole e Olena estate and 1987 became the first vintage of the 'Collezione De Marchi Chardonnay'. In 1989, a new vineyard was planted with five different clones from Burgundy (planted at a density of 5,000 vines per hectare), which came into full production from the 1994 harvest. Produced entirely with carefully picked and hand-selected Chardonnay grapes. After the classic white winemaking processes and fermentation in barrel, the wine remains on the lees in oak barrels, of which one third were new, for approximately 10–12 months. The wine was stirred occasionally during the first 6 months, in the Burgundian style, to give more texture and complexity to the wine.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0684/6336/2367/products/Isole-Chardonnay.jpg?v=1690806936,BBW-WINE-679,134.0000000000

Isole e olena Cepparello's got a spot reserved in your cellar, to enjoy between 2023–2036.<br>Bright ruby red colour. Beautiful and seductive, with an impressive array of fruit and spice aromas. Black and red cherries, dark plum, blackberries, raspberries and strawberries, the rich fruitiness of the wine is touched with oak and vanilla spice. The full-bodied and red fruit palate is well-balanced with velvety tannins and a fresh, persistent finish.<br>This flagship Cepparello is 100% Sangiovese aged in French oak barrels. One of Tuscany's most compelling wines, the style emphasises finesse over power. The name Cepparello is taken from an old stream, Borro Cepparello, originating in the highest point of the vineyards on the Isole e Olena estate. The first Cepparellos were vinified in cement. The cellar was heated to induce malolactic fermentation and the wines were subsequently aged roughly equal parts Slavonian oak casks and smaller French oak barriques, with a dollop of chestnut barrels thrown into the mix.<br>Today, only the top selection of grapes from the estate's vineyards in Barberino Val d'Else are used to create this wine. The vineyard is located in the northern part of Chianti Classico, situated 400 metres above sea level, facing southwest, with primarily galestro (schistous clay) soils. After a manual harvest and gentle crushing, the must ferments on skins in oak vats for 3 weeks at 30–32°C. Délestage and pumping over is carried out twice a day to give good colour and soft tannins. The maceration tank is emptied of the fermenting must, the cap dried out for 4–5 hours and then the must is poured back over the cap. After malolactic fermentation, the wine is racked into barrels. The wine is 100% barrel-aged, a third in new French and American oak (with American barrels making up 5% of the total), a third in one-year-old oak and the remaining third in two-year-old oak. The wine ages in barrel for 20 months and then matures in bottle for one year before release.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0684/6336/2367/products/Isoleeolenacepparello.jpg?v=1690806941,BBW-WINE-680,204.0000000000
1978,Jansz Pipers River Vintage Cuvée 2015,8596619624767,Sparkling Wine,"1 class=""title"">Jansz Pipers River Vintage Cuvée</h1>
<div class=""content-description"">A sparkling wine of finesse, power and elegance. Crafted from the finest blocks of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay in the Jansz estate vineyard at Pipers River, this truly is a benchmark Tasmanian sparkling wine. Planted on deep free-draining ferrasol soils overlooking Bass Strait, these soils and climatic conditions combine to allow long, cool ripening, producing intensely flavoured fruit, balanced with lingering natural acidity.</div>
<div class=""content-description"">
<br>Each block is hand-picked and fermented as an individual batch. Gentle handling, partial fermentation in aged oak barrels for six months and complex assemblage blending results in this powerful and elegant wine. Extended ageing on yeast lees for a minimum of four years after secondary fermentation gives a wonderful complexity to the final wine.</div>
<div class=""content-description"">
<br>Pale gold colour with delicate bubbles. The intense bouquet features citrus zest, lemon curd and ripe peach overlaid with complex notes of sweet brioche, toast and honey. The elegant palate offers preserved lemon, white peach, wild strawberries and rose water flavours. Four years of ageing on yeast lees in bottle gives the wine a deep complexity and subtle nuances of nougat and roasted hazelnuts. Dry and gorgeous to drink, with a refreshing natural acidity on the finish.</div>

<br>This Riesling thrives under fine microclimatic conditions and in the loose, well-aerated and very calcareous soils in the valley floor near Cortina. Tender care of the vineyard and the well ventilated microclimate offer the best conditions for an optimal production of this varietal, so that an excellent quality of grapes can be guaranteed. The grapes are pressed and the stems are removed in the pneumatic tank press. A 6–8 hour cold maceration precedes pressing to enhance the fruitiness of the wine. Afterwards, the grapes are gently pressed and clarified through the natural settling of sediments. Alcoholic fermentation is carried out with pure strains of yeast at a controlled temperature of 19°C.<br>Elegant with a fine fruitiness. Bright greenish-yellow colour. Soft scents of ripe peaches, apricot and daffodil florals waft from the glass. The dominantly fresh peach flavours has layers of green apple and soft pear, hints of tropical pineapple and mango. Delicate and dry, with an enticing acidity and lively fullness in the mouth.<br>

<br>Grafted to slow-growing rootstock and trained on traditional wire trellises (Guyot), this 100% Gewürztraminer grows in the best vineyard zones amongst the valley floor around the centre of Cortina. The favourable location of the vineyards, ideal sunshine and well-suited climate allows the berries to develop its best character. The grapes are pressed and the stems are removed in the pneumatic tank press. A 6–8 hour cold maceration precedes pressing to enhance the fruitiness of the wine. Afterwards, the grapes are gently pressed and clarified through the natural settling of sediments. Alcoholic fermentation occurs with pure strains of yeast at a controlled temperature of 19°C.<br><div class=""page"" title=""Page 1"">

<div class=""column"">This velvety and elegant Pinot Noir is produced by Peter Zemmer in Alto Adige – the German-speaking part of Italy. It offers flavours of forest raspberry and fresh red cherries. Peter produces wines of very high quality, and four of them have won the “Two Glasses” award from Gambero Rosso – probably the most prestigious national wine competition in Italy. Peter’s secret is that his vineyard is located at 450 metres above sea level in the foothills of the Alps. <span style=""font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;""> These hills, a conglomerate of loam and chalk soils and its very well-suited climate, form the ideal basis for producing a Pinot Noir of highest quality.</span><span style=""font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"">Even in summer, cool winds from the glaciers help to preserve the natural acidity of the grapes.</span>

<br>The grapes are de-stemmed first, then fermented at a constant temperature of 26–28°C for about 7 days. The must is kept in contact with the skins through circulation pumping and gentle pressure from below. After two gentle rackings, half of this Pinot Noir is aged in large barrels of French oak for 8 months, and the remainder is aged in small casks of French oak (barriques) that are 2–3 years old. After blending, the wine is bottled and aged for an additional 6 months in the bottle.<br>Medium ruby and garnet colour. Captivating aromas of wild forest raspberry, fresh red cherry and dried cranberry. The dry and med-bodied palate possesses velvety flavours of fresh and dried red fruits, balanced by a mouth-watering acidity. Harmonious, mature and seductive with a persistent finish of cranberry and sour cherries.<br>Good to cellar for 5-6 years!<br>

The red fruit flavours are spliced with woody layers that bring truffle, mushroom and spice to mind. Elegant and textured with gentle tannins and a lively acidity.<br>Considerable emphasis on vineyard site selection and identification, within the variations of three basic components of the soil: clay, sand, and stone. Each parcel is vinified and matured separately to enhance its individuality, before combining in the final blend.<br>The Pinot Noir bunches are chilled to 3°C before being sorted on a conveyor and de-stemmed. The berries are then hand sorted before cold maceration ensues for 3–6 days at 8°C. Slower fermenting cultured yeasts are used for some of the fermentations, while approximately 80% of the blend is wild fermented. Fermentation temperatures vary between 26–30°C, depending on the nature of the sites. After pressing, the wine is racked and left to complete its malolactic fermentation and maturation in oak barriques. maturation in 228L barriques lasts for approximately 12 months in 20% new oak, 40% 2nd fill and 40% 3rd fill. The oak used is of a tighter grain and medium toasted.<br>Best drunk now till 2023.<br>

2002,Bouchard Finlayson Missionvale Chardonnay 2017,8596623294783,White Wine,"1>Bouchard Finlayson Missionvale Chardonnay</h1>
Cream, creamy, delightful creaminess. This outstanding wine opens with a nose of mild wood tones surrounded by lovely stone fruits and oaky vanilla butter. Dry, refreshing and savoury with a broad yet harmonious palate. Displays flavours of pineapple, white peach, quince, lime and lemon citrus, with the slightest hint of toasted hazelnut. The seamless, polished and creamy texture floats easily into a long vanilla and quince finish.<br>This wine will enhance with longevity and age.<br><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The name Missionvale originates from the historical mission hospital established on the domain property in the early 19th Century by Moravian Missionary Peter Leitner, who adopted this beautiful valley.<br>The Hemel-en-Aarde Valley and its associated terroir have proven itself to be one of the Western Cape’s most treasured Chardonnay locations. All grapes are harvested at optimal ripeness from Bouchard Finlayson's Estate to create one of the finest Chardonnays. Bouchard Finlayson's Chardonnay vineyards are planted exclusively to the 95 clone – particularly successful in the Hemel-en-Aarde and known for its structural intensity.<br>Bunches are pressed without crushing and settled overnight, before being transferred to French oak barrels. Here temperatures are monitored during the peak of fermentation, while the lees is left undisturbed and only partial malolactic fermentation permitted – in order to retain freshness. A third new oak was employed and maturation on primary lees took place for nine months.<br>

<br>Light salmon pink colour. The bouquet elicits aromas of rose water, strawberries, watermelon, candy floss and blackcurrant. Watermelon, lime and grapefruit citrus, and a hint of delightful zesty lychee notes linger on the tongue. Balanced with a good acidity and crisp, dry finish.</div>
<div class=""column"">
<br>Since the Mourvèdre (moor-vey-druh) grape is originally from the warm shores of the Mediterranean, it is heat-resistant and grows vigorously in the South African climate. Traditionally used for the production of high quality rosé wines in Provence, Noble Hill used their estate vineyard to try experimenting with the grape for themselves. Noble Hill's small vineyard of less than one hectare is pruned to retain a large number of growth positions. This reduces the vines’ vegetative vigour and yields a balance between growth and fruiting.</div>
<div class=""column"">
<br>The grapes are carefully selected and arrive in excellent condition at the winery. The grapes go through crushing and are left in the press, in contact with the skins, for 1–1.5 hours. This skin contact gives the wine its salmon and onion-skin colouration. The wine is fermented naturally in stainless steel tanks and bottled with minimal intervention.<br>

An area of intense beauty in Lombardy, the team at RIVO have truly captured Lake Como's essence in the bottle. This artisan Italian gin is made with passion and in-depth local knowledge of the naturally growing botanicals in Lombard.<br>Traditional ingredients like juniper, angelica, coriander and cardamom are joined by local ingredients foraged for by a team of botanists, which include salad burnet, winter savory, lemon balm and Breckland thyme. Sharp and fresh lemon balm joins core juniper notes before opening up to reveal scents of florals, citrus and Mediterranean herbs. The layers of wild herbs and fresh citrus notes are balanced, expressive and softly textured in the mouth. Savoury herbs dominate the palate, but notes of thyme and lemon balm come through on the finish.<br>RIVO Gin is distilled at the Italian Distilleria Quaglia, one of Italy’s oldest distilleries. Each botanical is distilled separately and to its best advantage. While the spices are left to macerate for 10 days in a 70% Italian grain alcohol, the freshly plucked botanicals are steeped for just 48 hours. The solutions are pressed and then distilled in a double-bottomed pot still. Each run takes a different length of time depending on the type of botanical and the quantity needed. Some can take up to 10 hours, while others take only 30 minutes. Finally, the distillates are married together and watered down to bottling strength of 43%.<br><strong>Serving tips:</strong> RIVO gin is smooth enough to sip neat, but is also sublime a classic cocktail like a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ginfoundry.com/cocktail/bees-knees-cocktail/"" rel=""noopener"">Bee’s Knees </a>or a <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.ginfoundry.com/cocktail/french-75-cocktail/"" rel=""noopener"">French 75</a>.

Buntsandstein is the predominant geological formation in the Palatinate (Pfalz) and owes its yellow to deep red colour to changing iron oxide content.

The juice is subsequently fermented in temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks and aged in the cellar of the historic Art Nouveau farm.</div>

Minami is the perfect companion for that special platter of aged cheeses at your next get together with family or friends.<br>Deep ruby-purple hue. Bold, powerful and wonderfully smooth. The bouquet is abound with dark fruits of blackberry, cassis and blueberry, with strong layers of coffee and chocolate. The palate has a great structure and complexity, with velvety tannins and a great acidic backbone to keep it fresh for years to come.<br>The wine's name 'minami' is a Japanese word meaning 'south', or 'heading south'. An appropriate name considering the location of the winery and the vineyards (on the far south of the town of Jumilla) chosen to produce Minami. Another interpretation of 'minami' is the concept of 'regeneration' or 'resurgence'. In recent years, farmers in the rural communities of La Raja and La Zarza began ripping out their vines in order to replace them with fruit and almond trees. But thanks to the interest shown by Casa Rojo in maintaining Monastrell production, several agriculturalists have now abandoned this practice and continue grape cultivation.<br>A 100% Syrah from a unique vineyard called “Los Guardiola”. The vineyard is located 900 meters above the Sierra del Carche, in the northern part of the La Raja Valley. Planted in 1980, the plot is trellised and north facing with about 9,000 strains of which Casa Rojo obtains a kilo per strain of yield due to green pruning and low yield per plant. Stony and clayey soil, with a large terroir structure. Manual harvest in the second half of September for optimal stretches of maturation. A first selection occurs in the field, second by bunch and third by grain in the cellar. Upon arrival at the winery, the grapes are drained for the production of a few litres of rosé and greater concentration. The grains of grapes enter stainless steel tanks by gravity, where they ferment at 29°C for 10 days following a maceration on skins and seeds for a month. Ageing occurs partly in New French oak barrels of 240 L for 24 months and another part goes to clay amphorae of 800 litres. The wine is assembled and rests for 5 months before bottling and refinement in cellars until it reaches perfection.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0684/6336/2367/products/Casa-Rojo-Minami.jpg?v=1690807133,BBW-WINE-742,153.0000000000

The palate has pleasant flavours of raspberry and strawberry, sweet pastries with cocoa, subtle warm spices reminiscent of vanilla and white pepper. Well-structured in the mouth with sweet, soft tannins and a juicy acidity. The medium finish is round, fresh and possesses even more wild red fruit.<br><strong>Fun Fact</strong>: Tempranillo is a dominant red grape in Rioja and its name comes from the Spanish <em>temprano</em>, meaning ""early"", which is fitting as it ripens earlier than other native grapes in Spain.<br>

<br>Casa Rojo's El Hombre Invisible comprises a blend of 95% Tempranillo and 5% Mazuelo. The grapes are grown on old vines planted in chalk, iron and clay soils on the hillsides of Rioja Alta, in vineyards close to the village of Cuzcurrita de Rio Tiron in the north-west of the region. The three different types of soil and influence from the Atlantic Ocean provides the grapes with plenty of character. About 5% of Mazuelo is added to the Tempranillo dominant blend in order to add colour and structure to the wine. The manually harvested grapes undergo a traditional fermentation in stainless steel tanks at a controlled temperature (28°C). Followed by ageing in French oak barrels (225 and 500 litres) for a year and in bottle for 9 months.<br><strong>Top Tip</strong>: Let The Invisible Man breathe for 1–2 hours before serving.<br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12411"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/alcohol-1-300x300.png?v=1642666758"" alt="""" width=""61"" height=""61"">13.5%<br><strong>* 1.5 L is available, please check with us for more details.</strong",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0684/6336/2367/products/2k_75cl-in-su_7_21.jpg?v=1690807143,BBW-WINE-745,63.0000000000

<br>*Did you know… Le Pigeoulet’s big brother is none other than Vieux Telegraphe – one of the greatest Chateauneuf du Pape domains known to man!<br>So drinkable, you'll wonder where the rest of the bottle went. This wine's an everyday drinker with a tender, fresh and fruity character. Deep magenta colour. Explosive red fruit gracefully harnessed by a mineral structure with notes of violet, liquorice and garrigue. Black cherry, purple plum, currant and dried raspberry flavours well-balanced with spicy pepper, wet stone and earthy notes. It's a jammy mouthfeel that doesn't weigh down the palate. Round with soft tannins and juicy acidity, it closes off in a medium long finish laced with pepper.<br>A Vin de Pays that comes from unclassified vines in the Vaucluse appellation, sourced from two parcels in vineyards with vines an average age of 30 years: 7.5 acres on the east bank of the Rhône and 29.5 acres in the municipality of Caromb, on lower southwest-facing slopes of Mont Ventoux. These vineyards were traditionally used for the family's personal consumption, and many of the unused grapes were sold off in bulk. Upon hearing this, Kermit presented the Bruniers the idea of creating a value-driven second label. The plan soon evolved into a collaboration between the family and Kermit.<br>The grapes are hand-picked and sorted twice at the vine, then a third sort in the winery. They are all destemmed, then undergo 25–30 days vinification in temperature-controlled concrete vats. Pneumatic pressing, then systematic malolactic fermentation. Maturation occurs for 12 months in 60hl foudres and the wine is bottled after light filtering.<br><strong>Top Tip</strong>: Decant the wine 30 minutes before serving and serve it at 15°C to enjoy it at its best.<br>

The botanicals are steeped in a pure, neutral grain spirit for 18 hours in macerating tanks. The macerate is then pumped into a still along with pure water. Steam jackets heat the macerate and the vapours go into the condenser, which cools the vapours to form the gin distillate. In a meticulously monitored process, the first fluid leaving the still, the ""heads"", is removed. Collecting the ""heart of the spirit"" throughout the run, the distillers then determine the end of the cycle and make the final cut, ""the tails"". This process takes approximately 7 hours and at this point, the ""heart cut"" is 142 proof.

<br>Indigenous indeed. Pascal Jolivet's uniquely minimalistic and biodynamic vinification methods let nature take its course, resulting in an elegant wine that truly reveals the complexities and expressions of its terroirs. This wine was named indigène because it was fermented with indigenous yeasts only.<br>Powerful and full-bodied. Opens with a waft of generous grapefruit and lemon citrus, followed by notes of slate and gun-flint. Secondary flavours of green apple, pear and honey emerge on the palate. Taut and intriguing with an attractive mouthfeel and pronounced minerality. Rich, deep and age-worthy.<br>

<br>
<div class=""fl-callout-text"">
<br>Indigène is a wine blended from a meticulous parcel-by-parcel selection of Sauvignon Blanc old vines in the heart of the Tracy sur Loire village. All parcels are vinified separately. The grapes are hand-picked and sorted, then gently pressed. The juice is then fermented with indigenous yeast only in stainless steel at 18°C for 25 days. Aged for 12 months on lees in thermo-regulated stainless steel tanks before bottling, which occurs without filtration or cooling.<br>

Warm And Sturdy, Lively, Full Bodied, Pleasant And Harmonious.<br>Peiragal is an ancient dialect word of Barolo village that identifies hills with a good slope composed of calcareous compact soil and clay with big stones.<br>This particular soil composition, in addition to the good slope limits the absorption of rain forcing, promoting a very deep grounding of the vines that go in search humidity, by capillary action, from the deep layers. As a result, the Barbera d’Alba, Peiragal is a very fruity wine with a moderate acidity and a moderate alcohol content. The tannins are sweet but not too much in evidence.<br>The grapes are collected exclusively by hand and quickly taken to the cellar where they are destalked and softly pressed to extract from the peel and the outer area of the grape only the most noble and aromatic fractions. Fermentation, at controlled temperature, takes place in thermo-conditioned tanks. After maceration, that lasts 9 days between 28-30° degrees C. (86-89° F.), the wine is racked once the fermentation is completed. The wine is decanted in cement vitrified vats, specially made with a cork insulation, keeping for long time the post-fermentation temperature of 22° degrees C. (71.6°F.). In this way the malolactic fermentation starts spontaneously, ending in the month of December.<br>The maturation, that lasts for one year in small French Barrels (225 Liters) moderately toasted, allows the wine to attain a perfect combination between tannin, acidity and alcohol. The wood imparts a soft boisé note, never too strong, and increases the wines richness. This wine achieves a beautiful balance as no flavor overpowers the others, rather they all blend together in one uniquely pleasant experience. The Barbera d’Alba, Peiragal reaches its maturity after 2 years from the harvest and the plateau of maturity is between 2 and 5 years.<br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12411"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/alcohol-1-300x300.png?v=1642666758"" alt="""" width=""53"" height=""53"">14%<br> <br><h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Awards and Accolades</span></strong></h3><br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-14823"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/JS_92-300x300.jpg?v=1642750893"" alt="""" width=""132"" height=""132""><br><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-12857"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/22.png?v=1642667103"" alt="""" width=""60"" height=""54""><br>A purplish ruby red color with a fresh, live, with clean scents of black currants, berries, toasted hazelnut and vanilla.

<div class=""paragraph"">
<br>“Merlettaie” means lace. The name of this wine pays homage to the lace workers of Offida, who weave threads together with precise and quick finger movements. They are the last witnesses of a precious art of ancient origin, a similarity it shares with Pecorino grapes. Pecorino is a noble, austere, harsh and strong grape that has been confined to the bare and steep slopes of the Piceno Apennines for decades. A few wine growers have recently rediscovered this wine thanks to their love and enthusiasm.<br>Harvested by hand from vineyards in the towns of Offida and Acquaviva Picena, in Ascoli Piceno province at 280m above sea level. Pecorino is rare and precious, ethereal and persistent. Fermentation in “noble” wood enhances its personality and strength, a perfect example of the past combined with new oenological knowledge. The decanted must is fermented in medium-sized oak barrels and aged for approximately 6 months on lees. The wine is then refined for 3 months in bottle prior to release.<br> <br>

<div class=""column"">Sourced from Wairau Awatere Valley, the carefully selected fruit is crushed and cold soaked for 4–6 days. Fermentation on skins lasts for 16–29 days. Gently fermented to avoid over-extraction to produce a soft gentle Pinot Noir. Yeasts that can handle high temperatures are added during fermentation to help stabilise the colour and heighten flavours in the wine. Ageing occurs on good quality clean lees in French oak for 6 months.</div>

<em>""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.""</em> — Aristotle.</div>
<div class=""column"">
<br>A delicious, award-winning Pinot Gris created with fruit from Marlborough, Waipara and Hawke's Bay wine regions. Each parcel of Pinot Gris was manually harvested at optimum ripeness. Short skin contact adds flavour and texture to the wine. Fermented in stainless steel tanks, selected aromatic yeasts were used to make the wine more intense. Fermentation is stopped early to retain the small amount of acidity and natural sugar that gives the wine its off-dryness. The wine was held on lees for two months to help build mouth feel and texture, then blended and bottled.<br>Light gold colour. An enticing Pinot Gris with generous fresh pear, white peach and pineapple aromas. Nuances of white rose and honeysuckle add a touch of floral presence. Ripe fruit flavours on the palate are balanced with a light capsicum and subtle spice background. A creamy mouthfeel that leads into a lively and lingering off-dry finish.<br>

2121,Riedel 'EXTREME' Junmai,8596642103615,Stemware,"1>Riedel 'EXTREME' Junmai</h1><br>This sake glass is specifically designed for Japan’s national drink. In contrast to Daiginjo, Junmai boasts a much greater complexity and range, making it the perfect companion for food. At first glance, the shape of the new glass may cause some confusion, as it might well be taken for a cocktail glass owing to its wide rim. This is, however, necessary to evenly disperse the grain-inflected, woody and sherry-like aromas of rich matured Junmai sakes. These aromas would be overbearing in a close-mouthed glass. The diamond-shaped base, which was developed from Riedel’s Extreme series, controls the flow so that the liquid stays on the tongue, highlighting the sake’s velvety texture. Riedel recommends the Junmai glass for fuller and umami-dense types of Junmai, such as Kimoto and Yamahai, or rich matured brews displaying complex notes of caramel, dried fruit and mushroom. Aromatic types with lighter body and pure characteristics – such as Daiginjo, Ginjo, Junmai Daiginjo and Junmai Ginjo are best served in the Daiginjo glass.<br><span id=""productInfoDescriptionText"" class=""product-info__description-text product-info__description-text--more collapse in"" aria-expanded=""true""><strong>This pack contains two glasses.</strong> Machine-made and dishwasher safe. </span><br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12277"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/line-e1590996348338-300x30.png?v=1642666597"" alt="""" width=""422"" height=""42""><br><h5>Caring for your RIEDEL Crystal</h5><br><ul>

2127,AMASS Botanic Vodka,8596643447103,Vodka,"A delicately floral, citric spirit that’s mellow on the palate. It delivers floral notes perfect for that martini or tonic drink, without the aggressive lash of juniper found in most gins. This botanic vodka opens with a nose of warm lemon drop candy. Citrus aromas soon evolve into scents of hay and sweet tea, before fading to frost and cold iron. The palate reveals initial bitter lemon, then grassy notes of dry summer and iced tea. The finish reminisces on hay and wild flowers before completing with a grainy sweetness. Inspired by the city's long summer evenings and longer winter nights. The result is a light, elegant spirit that pays tribute to Nordic drinking tradition, perfectly suited for a variety of cocktails and seasons.",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0684/6336/2367/products/Amass-vodka.jpg?v=1690807448,BBW-SPRT-142,99.0000000000

<br>“The key to making a great gin is sourcing good botanicals, and we have the most exotic botanicals available in the local markets and household kitchen of India.” — Sakshi Saigal, Third Eye Distillery co-founder.<br>Opens with a bold and aromatic citrus character, followed by warming sweet liquorice and a persistent spicy undertone. The palate features a big dose of juniper with notes of warm pepper, nutmeg and Gondhoraj limes. The finish is a peppery cinnamon that warms and lingers beautifully. Exotic, fresh and vibrant.<br>Distilled in Goa, India, by a trio who are committed to creating a great gin from local exotic botanicals. The variety of botanicals in this gin include home-grown black pepper, citrus peels, coriander, liquorice, nutmeg, mace, cassia bark, and plenty of juniper. This gin uses a mix of four different kinds of citrus peels, led by Gondhoraj limes. Stranger &amp; Sons Gin is made in an iStill, a one-shot process that sees the citrus peels get the longest maceration. Next is the addition of juniper, pepper, coriander and nutmeg. The cassia, mace and liquorice go in last since these spices only require a light touch.<br>Fun fact: Gondhoraj limes are a citrus from Kolkata (Calcutta) that tastes like a cross between lime and mandarin orange.<br> <br>

<div class=""column"">The blend comprises of 37% Pinotage, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc, 1% Petit Verdot. All the grapes are picked by hand and placed into 18kg lug-boxes. At the cellar, the bunches are de-stalked and go through three stages of sorting: sorting machine, vibrating table and computer-controlled optical sorter. The crushed fruit is pumped into open top concrete fermenters (each holding 10 tons), where maceration occurs for 3–5 days on skins at 28°C. To ensure optimum yet delicate tannin and colour extraction, the cap was punched down manually every 2 hours. Finally, the wine was matured for 12 months in 2nd and 3rd fill 225L French Nevers oak barrels. This wine will keep developing in the bottle for the next 5–7 years.<br>

<br>From what was initially lauded as an outstanding vintage for Coonawarra, Penley Estate's 2018 Helios Cabernet Sauvignon is one of the first of the vintage's top wines I've tasted from bottle. It doesn't disappoint. Deep cassis fruit is accented by hints of cedar and exotic spices, including hints of cardamom and cinnamon. In the mouth, this medium-bodied wine is surprisingly airy and lithe with supple tannins. Not a conventional blockbuster, it's built on elegance and silk, with bright fruit and acids and a crisp, focused finish. I suppose it will disappoint those looking for something Napa-esque, but it appears to take its cue from recent vintages of Wynn's John Riddoch bottling, offering something more balanced and drinkable—and perhaps a truer reflection of Coonawarra Cabernet.<br>

<div class=""column"">A wine touched by bears! Katogi Averoff vineyards are situated in the brown-bear habitat in Metsovo, so it's common for bears and their little cubs to visit the vineyards and enjoy grapes of their choice. Bright ruby red with hints of purple. Dominant aromas of red fruit and spice with hints of tomato, violet and liquorice. Smooth tannins, a complex structure and acidity that keeps this wine's crisp freshness for years. An extraordinary wine with a remarkable aftertaste.<br> <br>In Metsovo’s local Vlach dialect, 'inima' means ‘heart and soul’. This wine expresses the positive energy and enthusiasm of all who put their heart and soul into its production. Pre-fermentation maceration at 12–15°C for seven days. Fermentation for approximately 20 days at 30–32ºC. Then the young wine is transferred to 300 litre French Nevers-oak barrels for malolactic fermentation to take place. Here it sits on lees for a period of two months. Malolactic fermentation is followed by batonnage and further ageing for a minimum of ten months.</div>

<div class=""column"">A sexy and seductive bottle of wine this one ;)<br>Bolgheri Rosso was born on the Grattamacco estate, located on the top of a hill overlooking the sea between Castagneto Carducci and Bolgheri. Fun fact: <strong>Bolgheri is the terroir for top wines such as Sassicaia and Ornellaia. </strong><br>Characterised by a dark garnet red colour. The nose explodes with plum and cassis, followed by earthier notes of spice, wild herbs and chocolate. A dense and powerful wine elegantly balanced with ripe tannins. This juicy and rich wine closes with a pleasant mineral sensation and hints of fresh balsamic notes.<br>From a vineyard 100m above sea level that enjoys a gentle Mediterranean climate. This wine is produced with a blend of 50% cabernet sauvignon, 20% cabernet franc, 20% merlot and 10% sangiovese grapes. The grapes are hand selected during the harvest and posed in truncated conical shaped oak vats. They then experience an aerobic fermentation and a manual punching down for the gentle extraction of tannins. After malolactic fermentation in stainless steel vats, the wine ages for 10 months in French oak barriques followed by 6 months of refining in bottle.<br>To enjoy it at its best, let the wine breathe for 15–30 minutes before serving.</div>

<br>Brick red colour. Bold aromas of wild raspberry and cassis create a primary fruit intensity, assisted with notes of dried berries and herbs. The palate has an attractive concentration of cherry fruit and touches of spice. Complex and deep with an earthy, floral character. It's silky texture is balanced with fresh notes and a long, distinguished finish.<br><div class=""column"">
<br>As a vintage, 2014 caused a few flutters for growers because of its cool and humid nature. Only a single cask of Brunello was produced in 2014 due to the rather demanding climatic conditions and resulting smaller harvest (3–3.5 tons per hectare). The grapes were subsequently declassified and crafted with painstaking attention to detail into an exceptional Rosso di Montalcino. After malolactic fermentation, the wine was aged for 2 years in 30 hl Slavonian oak casks with an additional 6 months in bottle.<br>

The award winning Red House Macho Man Monastrell appears intense garnet with purple highlights, notes of sweet balsamic and peppery spice, mingled with persistent ripe red and black fruit on the nose. Fresh, silky, long, elegant and unique.The palate is full with silky blackberry fruit and sweet plum jam, toasted spice, rosemary, thyme, balsamic. Finishing particularly fetching with even more sweet fruit and austere of smoke and spice. Casa Rojo Macho Man Monastrell is an excellent red that will age well 5-7 years and please allow to breathe 1-2 hours.<br><br>The grapes are from 7 plots of Monastrell vineyards in La Raja (where the winery is located) between the mountain ranges of El Carche and La Pila. The vines range from 20 to 70 years old, in the south of Spain. The poor, shallow and calcareous soils, along with the extremely dry climate of the area, will cause the plant to suffer a lot of stress and have very little vigor, the result is very high quality fruit.<br>Monastrell of this area is traditionally cultivated in a 3 x 2 or 3 x 3 frame, goblet pruned. The grapes are hand harvested in little boxes of 15 kg during the second and third week of September, at the optimal maturation stage. Harvest is carried out during the first hours of the day so that grapes enter the winery with a temperature of around 15ºC. The grapes go through two selection tables before entering into the deposits. Fermentation is carried out in truncated-cone shaped tanks of 7,000 liters (the hat is thinner and this inverse shape allows softer and less aggressive pressings) at a controlled temperature of 25º C.<br>Aged in brand new French oak barrels, 240 and 450 liters size from four cooperages (Seguin Moreau, ANA, Saint Martin and Saury). Macho Man Monastrell also ages inside 800-liter Roman clay amphoras.<br>Also, how cute is the bottle!

<div class=""column"">Textured and savoury. A delicious bouquet of blackberries, violets and crushed pepper. The palate is a harmonious dance of spiciness, silky tannins and delicate purity of fruit. There’s great depth and flavour to this wine, bolstered by layered hints of oak.<br>The Gabrielskloof Landscape Series of wines is an authentic representation of their top vineyards, as well as a few old vine treasures. The labels feature landscape paintings by Niël Jonker that reflect and capture the spirit of Overberg landscapes.Sandstone defines the character of this single vineyard wine. The Syrah from Sandstone site is mountainous and composed of broken Sandstone rock. This merciless environment leads to low vigour and small yields, which results in complex and unique wines. Gabrielskloof was able to irrigate their vines at precisely the right moments, which was crucial to achieving full ripeness. Markedly low yields and small berries lead to extra gentle handling and extraction.

Hailing from Puglia Italy, B.io wines revolve around sustainability and certification, linked to goodness and quality. Its name probably derives from the fact that it is a rather early ripening grape. The plant produces purple grapes and is mainly grown in Puglia, where it is the most widespread varietal. It is thought to have originated in Dalmatia and this belief is borne out by its similarity to a number of Croatian varietals.<br>Analysis of the DNA has also confirmed the theory that Primitivo and Zinfandel (which originated in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and which has become one of the mainstays of California winegrowers) are actually the same grape.<br>Luscious and Intense red color with a complex bouquet reminiscent of cherries, raisins and toasted almonds. B.io Primitivo is plump and Full-bodied on the palate but at the same time mild and elegant. Long lasting pleasant aftertaste.<br>After destemming, Primitivo grapes are not pressed, but left intact to reduce the damage to the skins and optimize the extraction of the color. Fermentation takes place at a controlled temperature of 24-25°C for 8-10 days. During the early stages of fermentation, the grapes are repeatedly racked and returned to bring out their aroma and tannins.<br>Wines with rich flavours and aromas are a good choice when serving meat dishes.

It is very well structured that will age beautifully.

The grapes pass through a quality control before being crushed, in order to avoid mainly raisins, and in some varieties possible Botrytis problems. After being crushed, the grapes are cooled down and periodically trodden by foot in granite ""lagares"" until the sugar contents of the must reaches the required level. This process lasts in average for three days. The must is then racked to the storage vats and wine brandy is added to stop fermentation.

After extensive sorting, the grapes were gently pressed without the addition of SO2 and the juice was allowed to settle in stainless steel before racking after 4 days. An experiment was conducted, in which 60% of the fermentation was performed by a selected yeast chosen for texture and aromatics, with the balance fermented by wild yeast thought to achieve the same results. The fermentation was arrested (AF) using cold temperature and the addition of SO2, when the residual sugar was thought to be in balance with the natural acidity. The wine was allowed to age on fine lees in stainless steel for 11 months before being bottled on September 10, 2018 without fining, but with the aid of filtration to prevent refermentation.<br>

<br>Finca Valdepoleo is one of the most emblematic vineyards of Bodegas y Viñedos Pujanza.

It comes from a vineyard divided into seven plots which are worked separately from the harvest to the end of cask ageing. This is the moment when, through blind tasting, the decision is made on what percentage of wine from each plot will go into the final coupage. Hence its complexity. Vintage 2013 Finca Valdepoleo is one of the most iconic Pujanza Vineyards where every year an accurate viticulture work is carried out according to geographical criteria.<br><div class=""page"" title=""Page 1"">

The grapes for Night Moves Gamay Noir were harvested in October.  The grapes then went through a destemmer and were then transferred as whole berries by gravity. The wine was fermented using the wild, indigenous yeast and left on the skins for 32 days post ferment. After draining the free run, the grapes were dug out of the tank and gently pressed, separating the press wine from the free run. The Gamay Noir is entirely composed of free run wine, with the press wine being used for the Notorious PTG. The free run wine was aged entirely in neutral French oak barrels for 11 months, before being racked out of barrel to settle in tank. The wine was bottled without fining, filtration or free SO2.

Some believe that 'negro' (black) is a clear reference to  its very dark colour, a peculiarity which has been particularly appreciated since the times of the Benedictine monks.  'amaro' (bitter) could refer to its strong tannins, or to the fact that in the past the wine was  left to ferment with the grape-skins for a long time therefore that by the end of fermentation it was dark and very bitter. The most probable explanation is that the name Negroamaro derives from the fusion of the Greek word mavros and the Latin word niger, both meaning “black” and referring to the colour of the grapes, so that  Negroamaro actually means black-black.<br><div>As is the case of other Italian vines, the origins of the Negroamaro plant itself are uncertain. It is most likely that it was brought to Italy by Greek colonists in about the 8th century  B.C., and found its ideal habitat in this rocky arid region.  What is certain about Negroamaro - one of Italy’s most ancient vines – is that it has an ancestral bond with Puglia, and as the symbol of the Salento is more than just a native vine.</div><br><div></div><br>Rivera wanted to interpret it in a fresh and flowing style with a modern vinification that enhances the intense aromas of small red fruits and the delicately balsamic notes typical of the variety.<br>Maceration for 8-9 days at 28 ° C with frequent pumping over. 9 months in vitrified cement tanks.

<br>2016 is a year of anniversaries for Riedel. The company is celebrating being in business for 260 years while Vinum - the company's most successful glassware range - is turning thirty. 1986 was not just an important year for Riedel but for all wine lovers around the world. The launch of the machine-made Vinum glass collection by Riedel Glas fundamentally changed the drinking glass culture. In 1973, Claus J. Riedel, the ninth generation of the family-run company, introduced a winefriendly, handcrafted and hand blown range of glasses. The ""Sommeliers"" range is now world famous. In 1986, his son, Georg J. Riedel, presented a further innovation which would become even more significant: the first varietal-specific machine-made glass in history – Vinum!<br>

<br><h1>St John's Road Blood &amp; Courage Shiraz</h1>
<br>
</div><br><h4>Success <em>never</em> comes easy. If it did, everyone would have it. It means taking a leap of faith. It means failing and getting straight back up again for another crack. It takes drive and an unwavering belief in yourself. It takes dogged determination. It takes grit. It takes <em>blood and courage.</em>
</h4><br>…<br>Blood &amp; Courage is our interpretation of quintessential Barossa Valley Shiraz. Power with elegance. Full and generous primary fruit flavours skillfully interwoven with oak characteristics from maturation in French oak Barriques and Hogsheads. This classic Barossa Shiraz is fresh and lively, yet rich in texture with subtle oak and soft, well integrated tannins – simply a stylish wine.<br>A wetter than average 2016 winter, and a mild summer with substantial early rains, lead to optimal soil conditions leading into the 2017 vintage. The result was a longer ripening period and greater yields which lead to increased florals and lovely elegance showing through in the Barossa Shiraz. The Shiraz fruit for our Blood and Courage comes from our Resurrection vineyard in Ebenezer, Paul and Angie Schutz’s vineyard in Stonewell and Andy Kalleske’s vineyard also in Ebenezer. Following harvest the grapes were fermented for 8 days in 10t open fermenters at 22 degrees. The grapes from our Resurrection Vineyard were barrelled down for 15 months in approximately 8% new French Barriques and Hogsheads, the Schutz parcel spent 6 months in French Hogsheads and the Kalleske parcel matured in stainless steel.<br>Medium density deep red with purple hues and a light purple rim. Bright red fruit characters of red cherry and raspberry. Florals of lavender and violet. Hints of roast meats and charcuterie. Slight white pepper and vanilla. Fruit sweetness coming through from bright red cherries and raspberries adds nice body to the mid palate. Fine tannins, medium length, very approachable with savoury characters balancing the fruit intensity.<br><strong>Seems like drinking wines from St John's vineyard gives us John Legend vibes, and rightfully so. Excuse me while I lay on my couch with ""I know better"" in surround sound.</strong><br><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12411"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/alcohol-1-300x300.png?v=1642666758"" alt="""" width=""57"" height=""57"">14.5%<br> <br><h3 class=""p text ""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">AWARDS &amp; ACCOLADES</span></strong></h3><br><p class=""p text ""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12695"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/Halliday_5star_2019_Live-300x300.png?v=1642749829"" alt="""" width=""141"" height=""141""><img class=""alignnone wp-image-12786"" src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0552/1339/1970/t/7/assets/NZ-International-Wine-Show-Medal-Gold1-1-300x300.jpg?v=1642749932"" alt="""" width=""149"" height=""151"">",https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0684/6336/2367/products/Stjohns-Shiraz.jpg?v=1690808065,BBW-WINE-973,53.0000000000

Fruit for The Resilient was sourced from four vineyards located in the mid to northern Barossa Valley - the Schutz family vineyard in Stonewell, the Hampel and Schiller sites in Ebenezer and Merv John’s acreage in Light Pass. Picking occurred between early March and mid April. Following harvest, the Grenache grapes were crushed into 10T open-top fermenters with a portion of the fruit going through malolactic fermentation in stainless steel.

It’s Snap, Crackle and Pop.<br>Grenache, Mataro and Shiraz are three of the great red grape varieties that are cornerstone to the Barossa’s red winemaking pedigree. A traditional style using classic Barossa grape varieties, we looked for structure and integration of flavours. Grenache provides the sumptuous savoury, spice and fragrance, and a gentle earthiness and leather with age. Mataro contributes deeper gamier flavours and flesh to the palate whilst Shiraz acts as a strong foundation to the blend, giving colour and structure.<br>Enticing aromatics of plush red fruits. Strawberry, red currant and raspberry. A hint of sweet spice. Fresh, lush fruits are well balancedl with savory notes of earth, cedar and sandalwood spice.

An atypical wine for the Marmandais region. Côtes du Marmandais is an appellation that is very similar to <a href=""https://yourwineiq.com/kindsofwine/winebyregion/europe/france/southwest/cotesduduras.html"">Côtes du Duras</a>; both are located right on the <a href=""https://yourwineiq.com/kindsofwine/winebyregion/europe/france/bordeaux.html"">Bordeaux</a> border but are fairly obscure. Côtes du Marmandais differentiates itself by allowing non-Bordeaux grapes Gamay and Syrah to be included in the blends. Reds are much more common than whites, but white wine production is increasing in the area. All in all, this is a developing region and could become more well-known over the next several years. Generally, Côtes du Marmandais wines are good, and for the right price it's difficult to go wrong. However, one wine producer has become especially notable in the last few years.<br>As Elian explains ""COUCOU BLANC DU MARMANDAIS is a heritage from my time spent working in Alsace"". Aromas are very expressive with complex quince and floral notes. Floral nose, wide mouth with a fresh attack apples and pear aromas of apricot and dried fruit.

Attempts have been made to cultivate the varietal in the wine growing counties of the New World, but the results are a far cry, qualitatively, from those acheived in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.

It finishes with mineral and good persistence. Fermentation in stainless steel, at a temperature of 14-16°C (57-61° F). Aging in tanks for two months and then at least two months in bottle before release. Still remains one of our favourites of Sicilian whites. Pairs well with oily, buttery dishes such as Risotto in cream sauce or <strong>chicken wings</strong>!<br>
